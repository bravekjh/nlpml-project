* When confronted with accusations that he didn't pay an architect for designing one of his clubhouses he defends it because ""maybe he wasn't happy with the work done"".

* Claims that stop and frisk wasn't ruled unconstitutional, then blames the ruling on an anti-police judge.

* Claims he is not racist because he settled an anti-discrimination lawsuit out of court, and then brags that it was easy to do.

* Claims that he was doing a service to Obama by forcing him to produce his birth certificate.

Trump made so many flubs and mistakes in the debate. It was pretty hard to keep count. But the biggest one in my opinion was how he buckled down on wanting to blow up an Iranian sailing vessel for taunting us.

TO SHOOT AT ANOTHER VESSEL IS AN ACT OF WAR. That will definitely start a war. And a war with a power that, if they don't currently have nuclear weapons, was at least 2 steps away from having them. 

And we started a [war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish%E2%80%93American_War#USS_Maine) over similar actions. [Twice.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_incident#Consequences)

I also like how he apparently has not commented on Russia doing [similar actions to our naval vessels](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/18/politics/russia-jets-buzz-u-s-ship-rules-of-engagement/) in open waters. And [our airplanes.](http://www.businessinsider.com/ap-navy-boss-russian-jets-should-stop-buzzing-us-planes-ship-2016-5)
