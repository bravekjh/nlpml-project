• No handshake surprised everyone I think. I wonder if their campaigns discussed this beforehand.

• Trump looked constipated and defeated from the get-go. Adopted a soft voice but couldn't help himself and settled into his usual aggression early on.

• Return of the sniffing.

• Anderson Cooper and Martha Raddatz came prepared and took no shit.

• A reality TV star dragged up rape claims against a former President in front of his wife and millions of people… and that cut to Bill's shocked face... what a time to be alive.

• So much petulance from Trump about time limits throughout. 

• ""If I were President at that time, [Captain Khan] would have been alive today.""

• Trump's genius military plan to defeat ISIS: ""Make it a sneak attack"".

• Probably the best soundbite of the night: ""Because you'll be in jail"".

• No knockout blow from Hillary but at this point her opponent has already been carried from the ring and is on his way to the morgue. 

• That last question. Name something positive that you respect about your opponent. Amazing.

Clinton lays out a comprehensive knowledge of global issues, and comprehensive plans for how to handle things in America. Trump doesn't really answer questions, spends most of his time being critical of what has happened with no nuance, and when he does lay out something, it's like a jot note in lieu of a plan and it's either to give rich people more money and fewer regulations which will somehow magically benefit the low and middle class, or by creating more competition with those lower taxes prices for stuff will be kept low. Am I crazy, or isn't that all that's being said in amongst the gibberish? And don't we already know that neither of those things work?

I want to hope that in the next 24 hours of sound bites it'll be very clear that Trump didn't answer a bunch of really important questions, and that he's very much out of his league.
