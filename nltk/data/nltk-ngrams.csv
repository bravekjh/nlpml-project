>so my plan -- we're going to renegotiate trade deals. we're going to have a lot of free trade. we're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now. but we have horrible deals. our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, nafta, one of the worst deals ever. our jobs are being sucked out of our economy. you look at all of the places that i just left, you go to pennsylvania, you go to ohio, you go to florida, you go to any of them. you go upstate new york. our jobs have fled to mexico and other places. we're bringing our jobs back. i am going to renegotiate nafta. and if i can't make a great deal -- then we're going to terminate nafta and we're going to create new deals. we're going to have trade, but we're going -- we're going to terminate it, we're going to make a great trade deal. and if we can't, we're going to do it -- we're going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster. we are going to cut taxes massively. we're going to cut business taxes massively. they're going to start hiring people. we're going to bring the $2.5 trillion ...that's offshore back into the country. we are going to start the engine rolling again, because... right now, our country is dying at 1 percent gdp.

leader, remember trump's missing tax returns and hillary defending a child 
who was raped. every candidate has flaws. obviously johnson will not win, 
but that's not why i'm voting for him. i'm voting for him to send a 
message! i want actual candidates to vote for!

hillary's ideas of a higher minimum wage and a debt free college are 
unrealistic. higher minimum wage will only cause inflation and cause the 
value of the us dollar to go down. minimum wage is just that! minimum wage, 
it's for entry level positions such as fast food. you will see higher pay 
if you actually applied yourself. so sit your whining asses down! you're 
not looking or applying yourself hard enough! quit trying to get everything 
handed to you! debt free college is unrealistic. i don't want my tax money 
to go help a student go to college and flunk out of remedial classes 
because they messed up back in high school or where ever they were 
educated. that's unrealistic, which removes jill stein from the equation.

trump's idea on abortion and gay marriage are too old fashioned for the 
america we have today. maybe work on the adoption programs and foster care 
we have in place before worrying about being against abortion. he sounds 
like a complete idiot. he'll run america like a business and not like a 
country. 

that's my opinion (as a current college student working a part-time job 
which technically is on minimum wage but + tips).

- - why did you americans let go bernie sanders?! are you out of your minds 
ffs?!

- - for me this election is odd i wasn't going to vote i don't normally care 
about politics the only reason i am voting is
to keep hillary clinton out of the white house. due to her mishandling of 
classified information, her taking massive amounts of
money from corporate backers, due to her sociopathic use of accusations of 
sexual misconduct against her opponent while having silenced multiple 
victims of sexual assault in the past when it suited her, her pulling money 
out of her foundation that
was intended to help people she insist's are going to be oppressed by her 
opponents, as well a large number of people who were supposed to testify 
against her have turned up dead and the fact she will likely start ww3 with 
russia i would have to say for me this election is about the morality of 
the candidates and don't misunderstand i don't think donald trump is an 
angel 
but even though i am a libertarian i would sacrifice every political view i 
have to keep that warmongering sociopath out of the white house i would 
have voted for bernie sanders over her and he and i dont agree on anything.
i feel sorry for american democrats that this wretched woman managed to 
sabotage bernies bid for the democratic nomination
as while i don't agree with his politics i wouldn't have bothered to vote 
against him since i think he is just a human with 
different political views then me and not actually a bad person (at least 
by politician standards) this woman stole your dnc nomination, she has 
silenced victims of sexual assault when it suited her, she breaks the laws 
of this country whenever she wants, is in the pocket of numerous corporate 
backers, is suspected though not proven guilty by myself and others of 
having people who testify against her killed, has been disgustingly 
contempt filled towards her own supporters in her emails,and people who 
work for her have been caught on video admitting to voter fraud, and 
inciting violence at trump rallies.
and to top it all off she is attempting actions that could spark a third 
world war. american liberals i implore you please
do not vote for this women she doesn't care about you,she has galvanized 
your opposition in this race,she has stolen your nomination from you, shown 
contempt for you,and lied to you. i understand fully your dislike of donald 
trump on both a personal level as he is brash and vulgar and on a political 
level i will never fault you for disagreeing with me or mister trump 
about political issues but the worst the man will do deregulate american 
business and make it difficult to immigrate to this country hillary will 
start a world war please don't let this sociopath play you. sanders or 
someone else can be elected on the
next go around but we have to have not been nuked in the next four years 
for that to happen please don't vote for her.
that said i hold no contempt for you even if you ignore me here. if you 
read this far i thank you for your time 
and regardless of weather this changes your opinion or you just move one or 
even if you spend the next week flaming me
i wish you the best

- - bernie sanders would have been great president

- - **attention** this video was linked to a website that is frequented by 
bernie sanders supporters. one of their signature posts is to pose as a 
foreigner and badmouth the united states. you can spot them a mile away.

- - how come bernie sanders is not in the running any more? do americans not 
want to change their country for the better?

- - god i miss bernie sanders.

- - honestly, i like bernie sanders better that these two candidates. bernie 
didn't have any scandals and is just..very fit for president! unlike donald 
trump! well, donald trump just drags on about the same thing and only 
criticizes hillary. also, his dumb idea to ""build a wall"" is terrible! how 
can this man become president. anyway, i find hillary slightly better 
because she has experience from bill clinton. that's not only why, but 
hillary can make the democracy a better place and totally doesn't make fun 
if people with disabilities. hillary is a fighter! this is my opinion about 
these candidates. as you can see, i would be satisfied if bernie sanders 
didn't lose the democratic nomination and can become president of the

to keep hillary clinton out of the white house. due to her mishandling of

money from corporate backers, due to her sociopathic use of accusations of 
sexual misconduct against her opponent while having silenced multiple 
victims of sexual assault in the past when it suited her, her pulling money 
out of her foundation that
was intended to help people she insist's are going to be oppressed by her 
opponents, as well a large number of people who were supposed to testify

have to keep that warmongering sociopath out of the white house i would 
have voted for bernie sanders over her and he and i dont agree on anything.

having people who testify against her killed, has been disgustingly 
contempt filled towards her own supporters in her emails,and people who 
work for her have been caught on video admitting to voter fraud, and 
inciting violence at trump rallies.

business and make it difficult to immigrate to this country hillary will 
start a world war please don't let this sociopath play you. sanders or

but, who cares? he is just going to be president of united states, and 
nobody should worry?

- - trump is a disgrace for united states and a national embarrasment. the 
entire world is laughing now. and who wouldn?

- - the only good statement in this debate is : "" look at the mess we`re up in 
"" 

remeber, the crisis that is going on in syria was rooted from somewhere.

you have to ask - why did the united states of america supply the iss with 
weapons and military training in the first place.
why !!! wake up.

we will never evolve as a species and make the world great for everyone if 
we are gonna join this circus, this sham. we all have to take a look in the 
mirror cus our children will be living in the day after tomorrow. think, 
just think !  

do you know what ""death"" always ask us humans - ""why do you always wait 
until it is too late""

- - everything will be ok. i mean, how bad can a sexual predator, a racist, and 
charlatan can be for president of united states?

- - the people of america need to go is go back and look at all the lies she 
has told over her investigation. look at trey gowdy breaking her down every 
time she side steps the questions. she repeatedly says she turned over 
everything and that has been proven time and time again that it is a lie.
anyone that votes for hillary is agreeing to continue conforming to 
government brain washing and lies. if you are happy with the way the 
government is today, and do not want or care if it changes for the better, 
then go ahead and vote for more consistent failure, and believe the lies 
that you will be told to cover up her failures if you put her in the white 
house. 
she knows if trump is elected that all the truth will finally come out, as 
it should,
wake up america - no more lies
do yourself a favor and vote for trump as president of the united states of 
america

- - so trump saying united states is a third world country.. wow lol, singapore 
1 world liao 😂😂

- - is here any chinese who watched this video.i think you guys would be very 
angry on donald trump.even i was thinking why he particularly pointing out 
chinese.but still i think his election manifesto would bring some change in 
united states.

- - ww3

“as president i will make it clear, that the united states
will treat cyber-attacks, just like any other attack. we will be ready with
serious political economic and military responses.” hillary clinton
at this point, i don't care if donald trump felt up 100000 women and 
melania trump filed the video!

- - wealthy business isn't leaving the us because of taxes, they are leaving 
because of it cheaper to make products in developing countries than in 
united states. trump is a liar and a manipulative person, he wants to make 
rich people , more rich.

- - an inspection by the independent of more than 25 different items of ivanka 
trump’s range at the macy’s flagship store in new york city, found not a 
single one was produced in the us. a sales assistant confirmed that no 
items in the collection were made at home.
trump shirts are made in bangladesh.
trump neckties are made in china.
trump suits are made in mexico.
trump cuff-links are made in china.
trump vodka is made in the netherlands.
trump crystal bar-ware is made in slovenia.
some trump products also are made in the united states, including the 
candidate’s iconic ""make america great again"" baseball cap, which is 
manufactured in california. and his cologne (that stinks)

- - **attention** this video was linked to a website that is frequented by 
bernie sanders supporters. one of their signature posts is to pose as a 
foreigner and badmouth the united states. you can spot them a mile away.

- - the united states is so screwed 😭😭

- - so the fema camps, the election fraud, the marcial law, and the antichrist 
obama and his muslims brothers taking over united states are not happening 
anymore, as many allready said it? saad! its everything over then? can i 
get out of my hole now? is it safe to come outside now?

- - honestly, i like bernie sanders better that these two candidates. bernie 
didn't have any scandals and is just..very fit for president! unlike donald 
trump! well, donald trump just drags on about the same thing and only 
criticizes hillary. also, his dumb idea to ""build a wall"" is terrible! how 
can this man become president. anyway, i find hillary slightly better 
because she has experience from bill clinton. that's not only why, but 
hillary can make the democracy a better place and totally doesn't make fun 
if people with disabilities. hillary is a fighter! this is my opinion about 
these candidates. as you can see, i would be satisfied if bernie sanders 
didn't lose the democratic nomination and can become president of the 
united states.

- - trump wants to turn united states into a dictatorship. that is why he keeps 
praising puting. he is a danger for democracy and for freedom..

- - i am a 13 year old girl who has just watched the debate on november the 2 
2016 that can realize that donald j. trump , is not good for the us ,not 
only because he belittles women but because he is going to make dictator of 
korea kim jong un want to bomb us even more... then adults should realize 
it to. i do not like hillary but she has expirence in the politcial system 
so she is better than trump but at this point in the election anyone 
is.watch michelle obamas speech about human decency and how trump should 
not brag about sexually asulting women and you will want to think twice 
about your vote for trump. on november the eighth 6 days from now vote for 
hillary clinton. again this is from a 13 year old girls prespective. if 
adults can't see this then america...start thinking for once! vote hillary 
for president if you want to ""make america great again"". vote for hillary 
clinton for the president of the united states of america.

true american. he will make america great again. :)

- - hillary is going to win but trump is right. america is a laughing stock. 
trump can make america great again but hillary can make china, middle east 
and russia great again.

- - please be educated. 
don't vote just because he said '' make america great again'' , question it 
, how will he make it great again? 
weigh the good and the bad.

- - he doesn't even have a plan. he barely answers the questions and cuts her 
off every time it's time for her to answer. he has no respect for women and 
it amazes me that people voted him to be our next president. he's a 
business man and has no background in politics and to top it all off, he's 
openly racist. y'all don't realize how big of a mistake yall made electing 
this creepy clown as president. he's not about to help anybody out unless 
you're wealthy. he's not about to ""make america great again"" he's about to 
have america right back to how it was in the 30's-60's. y'all are so dense 
and ignorant to what this man is really about.

- - if trump wins he will make america great again literally. crate wealth for 
all lower class guaranteed the way i see it with his credentials. if 
hillary wins america is going to continue getting ruined by china and 
others and she's going to increase tax on 50k plus annual wage people/

already planned my future in usa with my cousin/best friend, it all will 
crash down if he wins. i'm not saying hillary is better or smarter but 
seriously he has a lot of dumb ideas, he wants to remove muslims from the 
country and build a wall. many families will be separated! i understand 
that he mostly thinks about isis but that doesn't mean all of the muslims 
are dangerous. 95% muslims are really peaceful. i wouldn't even hurt a fly.

- - i would rather have crooked hillary for president than idiot trump, because 
he doesn't know anything about politics! he's inherited his wealth from his 
father, hating immigrants and wanting to build a wall to keep others out. i 
don't want him to be president, if he does and i go to the us to visit my 
family and he keeps me out, i'm not backing down. vote for hillary!!

- - listen here's my opinion i'm with hillary idc if u say hillary is bad if 
donald trump is racist and wants to build a wall u really think it will be 
that way...wrong he's gonna do something to the mexicans he cares about his 
race not blacks mexicans ect he want to get rid of us hillary is just a 
liar and very sneaky but trump is worse he's mental hillary a liar so why 
should we vote

- - what should happened when trump looses by the largest margin in 
presidential election history? 

we will roundup all the trump supporters using the deportation police that 
trump wants....the trump supporters will be dropped off in georgia, where 
we will build a wall to keep them all in. we will not allow anything in or 
out of georgia, and we predict within 3 months that all the white trash 
will be dead. now that would be huge!

journal, homicide, rape and robbery increased and has been since the new 
person came in

- - *did he seriously just say $650 million isn't a lot?!* 0:37:00
0:50:00 there is nothing wrong with stop and frisk, the concept. the issue 
is who they were stopping and frisking, the reasons why, and how they were 
prosecuted versus those who weren't stopped and frisked and not prosecuted, 
for the same crimes if any crimes at all. they're also so cowardly both 
trump and clinton not saying what the true issue is. most of the guns here 
increasing gun crime are illegal gun owners. it has nothing to do with 
buying and background checks, because a 14 yr old gang banger isn't getting 
background checks because they're not buying guns. that means the 
government is not writing and enforcing proper and effective laws on 
imports. and they're also scared shitless of the nra.

- - its obvious clinton is a typical do-gooder of the left..she has a seething 
hatred of law enforcement always playing the race card e.g...stop and frisk 
laws ...if you dare challenge or debate the science you are a climate 
denier ....clintons idea to conquer isis is to sit down with them discuss 
the differences over a cup of tea singing.. kumbaya.!!! ...while at the 
sametime propping up the corrupt un with more foreign aid that the usa 
cannot afford....lol

- - i dislike both of these candidates. but if you actually do some research 
and look at the numbers and statistics trump knows what he's talking about. 
stop and frisk law isn't unconstitutional, it was where they were doing it 
that was. and new york murders are actually up.

- - the ""law and order"" part is where i decided to vote for hillary. she 
answered that question effectively. trump just rambled saying ""law and 
order"" and ""stop and frisk"" while ignoring what's been said to be 
unconstitutional. hillary even brought up mental health, more police 
training, etc. 

i tried very hard to look at both sides of this debate, without bias. trump 
just seemed very unprepared and that's really not a trait (among many) 
commander in chief should posses.

years, sad to say but yes i felt that way.

- - don't support trump, i think he's no different from the rest of them. but 
glad he brought up bill and his scandals and how hillary basically cleared 
him. he should have mentioned how she blackmailed a woman bill was having 
an affair with who worked at the white house as well.. just a shame that 
trump himself has sexual allegations and was happy to play golf with bill, 
for hillary and bill to attend his wedding(s) and that trump and hillary go 
way back, to the 60s. but hillary had way too much censorship and 
protection. warmongering scum bag

- - vote for me i'll turn the white house into a trap house.

- - is russia messing with our election in an effort to get donald trump into 
the white house?

the answer is yes.

trump has repeatedly dismissed the possibility. ""she has no idea whether
it's russia, china or anybody else,"" the republican nominee said during
the final presidential debate when hillary clinton stated that russian 
president vladimir putin was behind the hacking of democratic national 
committee emails. he added: ""hillary, you have no idea.""
clinton did have an idea -- the democratic nominee was correct to point 
the finger at russia. and trump, who had received a 
classified briefing on the subject, knew it.
""the u.s. intelligence community is confident that the russian 
government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from u.s. persons 
and institutions, including from u.s. political organizations,"" the 
department of homeland security and the national intelligence director's
office said in a statement the first week of october. they added:
""these thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the u.s. 
election process.""
now, less than a week before election day, it's becoming 
clear that russia isn't satisfied with stealing and disseminating email 
from democratic party groups. it looks likely our former cold war 
adversary is also creating counterfeit documents to support trump's 
baseless claim that the election system is ""rigged"" against him.
""the fbi and u.s. intelligence agencies are examining faked 
documents aimed at discrediting the hillary clinton campaign as part of a
broader investigation into what u.s. officials believe has been an 
attempt by russia to disrupt the presidential election,"" reuters 
reported on thursday.
among the documents that are being examined, the news 
service wrote, is a fake letter from delaware sen. tom carper, a key 
member of the senate's homeland security committee. in the letter, he 
tells clinton he will secure the election for her. reuters added:
in addition to the carper letter, the fbi has also 
reviewed a seven-page electronic document that carries the logos of 
democratic pollster joel benenson's firm, the benenson strategy group, 
and the clinton foundation, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
the document, identified as a fake by the clinton 
campaign, claims poll ratings had plunged for clinton and called for 
""severe strategy changes for november"" that could include ""staged civil 
unrest"" and ""radiological attack"" with dirty bombs to disrupt the vote.
some fringe right websites have already heralded the fake 
documents, presenting them as legitimate. the possibility of a russian 
disinformation campaign, with fraudulent documents mixed in with real 
ones, is one reason the clinton campaign has not authenticated any of 
the dnc emails that the transparency site wikileaks has been releasing day 
by day.

- - i have obama care and let me tell you it is the best care anyone can have 
who can't afford anything and i do mean. i am 26 years old and for 12 years 
after my mom lost her job i was not able to get health care because they 
either said she made too much, she made too little and/or i was too young. 
obamacare makes it possible for people like myself 2 get health insurance 
for your list of what the status is of my income. i work 2 and 3 jobs i get 
minimum wage or lower and i still cannot afford health care if it wasn't 
for obamacare. if you republicans think that we lower class people are 
going to let you take away something like this you're out of your freaking 
minds. it is simple republicans you want the white house make healthcare 
affordable for lower-class americans find ways to improve our security fund 
our schools and our colleges and will give you the white house on a silver 
platter

- - his idea of running the country, is making himself look like he matters, 
making himself look like he is wanting to help the little people.or other 
races. he may help other races as long as they are wealthy. he is more 
unfit to run this country then the person we just had in office. we need 
someone who is going to genuinely care about every aspect of our security, 
our liberty, our posterity, our education. not someone who just wants to be 
in the white house and take vacations, or let the house run the country. we 
need someone who is going to be there for all of us> not just the wealthy.

races and she's lying. emails, corruption... she's words are trash. who 
like obama should vote for donald. i like obama and trump will be better. 
we don't need criminals in white house. trump 2016

- - what every single person should love about trump is the fact he is not 
afraid to expose the elite and the establishment. he wasn't afraid to 
expose the other 16 or whatever republicans and he wasn't afraid to bring 
up bills past. so many think ""bill past doesn't matter because he is not 
running"" just think of what you are saying.. what a bad excuse. letting 
bill clinton anywhere near the white house should be banned. if i was trump 
on day 1 i would put a lifelong restraining order against bill and hillary 
so they could never enter the white house again. those 2. bill and hill. 
they both ruined others lives! such great people went to jail for doing 
just 1 of the bad things she's done. this is a fact. i can name hundreds of 
other cases. also bill clinton flew on a convicted pedo's plane 27 times. 
he is part of an under ground underage sex ring and that is sick.

in addition to the carper letter, the fbi has also 
reviewed a seven-page electronic document that carries the logos of 
democratic pollster joel benenson's firm, the benenson strategy group, 
and the clinton foundation, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
the document, identified as a fake by the clinton 
campaign, claims poll ratings had plunged for clinton and called for 
""severe strategy changes for november"" that could include ""staged civil 
unrest"" and ""radiological attack"" with dirty bombs to disrupt the vote.
some fringe right websites have already heralded the fake 
documents, presenting them as legitimate. the possibility of a russian 
disinformation campaign, with fraudulent documents mixed in with real 
ones, is one reason the clinton campaign has not authenticated any of 
the dnc emails that the transparency site wikileaks has been releasing day 
by day.

- - i have obama care and let me tell you it is the best care anyone can have 
who can't afford anything and i do mean. i am 26 years old and for 12 years 
after my mom lost her job i was not able to get health care because they 
either said she made too much, she made too little and/or i was too young. 
obamacare makes it possible for people like myself 2 get health insurance 
for your list of what the status is of my income. i work 2 and 3 jobs i get 
minimum wage or lower and i still cannot afford health care if it wasn't 
for obamacare. if you republicans think that we lower class people are 
going to let you take away something like this you're out of your freaking 
minds. it is simple republicans you want the white house make healthcare 
affordable for lower-class americans find ways to improve our security fund 
our schools and our colleges and will give you the white house on a silver 
platter

- - his idea of running the country, is making himself look like he matters, 
making himself look like he is wanting to help the little people.or other 
races. he may help other races as long as they are wealthy. he is more 
unfit to run this country then the person we just had in office. we need 
someone who is going to genuinely care about every aspect of our security, 
our liberty, our posterity, our education. not someone who just wants to be 
in the white house and take vacations, or let the house run the country. we 
need someone who is going to be there for all of us> not just the wealthy.

- - for me this election is odd i wasn't going to vote i don't normally care 
about politics the only reason i am voting is
to keep hillary clinton out of the white house. due to her mishandling of 
classified information, her taking massive amounts of
money from corporate backers, due to her sociopathic use of accusations of 
sexual misconduct against her opponent while having silenced multiple 
victims of sexual assault in the past when it suited her, her pulling money 
out of her foundation that
was intended to help people she insist's are going to be oppressed by her 
opponents, as well a large number of people who were supposed to testify 
against her have turned up dead and the fact she will likely start ww3 with 
russia i would have to say for me this election is about the morality of 
the candidates and don't misunderstand i don't think donald trump is an 
angel 
but even though i am a libertarian i would sacrifice every political view i 
have to keep that warmongering sociopath out of the white house i would 
have voted for bernie sanders over her and he and i dont agree on anything.
i feel sorry for american democrats that this wretched woman managed to 
sabotage bernies bid for the democratic nomination
as while i don't agree with his politics i wouldn't have bothered to vote 
against him since i think he is just a human with 
different political views then me and not actually a bad person (at least 
by politician standards) this woman stole your dnc nomination, she has 
silenced victims of sexual assault when it suited her, she breaks the laws 
of this country whenever she wants, is in the pocket of numerous corporate 
backers, is suspected though not proven guilty by myself and others of 
having people who testify against her killed, has been disgustingly 
contempt filled towards her own supporters in her emails,and people who 
work for her have been caught on video admitting to voter fraud, and 
inciting violence at trump rallies.
and to top it all off she is attempting actions that could spark a third 
world war. american liberals i implore you please
do not vote for this women she doesn't care about you,she has galvanized 
your opposition in this race,she has stolen your nomination from you, shown 
contempt for you,and lied to you. i understand fully your dislike of donald 
trump on both a personal level as he is brash and vulgar and on a political 
level i will never fault you for disagreeing with me or mister trump 
about political issues but the worst the man will do deregulate american 
business and make it difficult to immigrate to this country hillary will 
start a world war please don't let this sociopath play you. sanders or 
someone else can be elected on the
next go around but we have to have not been nuked in the next four years 
for that to happen please don't vote for her.
that said i hold no contempt for you even if you ignore me here. if you 
read this far i thank you for your time 
and regardless of weather this changes your opinion or you just move one or 
even if you spend the next week flaming me
i wish you the best

- - what every single person should love about trump is the fact he is not 
afraid to expose the elite and the establishment. he wasn't afraid to 
expose the other 16 or whatever republicans and he wasn't afraid to bring 
up bills past. so many think ""bill past doesn't matter because he is not 
running"" just think of what you are saying.. what a bad excuse. letting 
bill clinton anywhere near the white house should be banned. if i was trump 
on day 1 i would put a lifelong restraining order against bill and hillary 
so they could never enter the white house again. those 2. bill and hill. 
they both ruined others lives! such great people went to jail for doing 
just 1 of the bad things she's done. this is a fact. i can name hundreds of 
other cases. also bill clinton flew on a convicted pedo's plane 27 times. 
he is part of an under ground underage sex ring and that is sick.

0, litterally 0 time clinton. i for one don't really care what happens to 
this country since i'm no usaian, but i find this very interesting and it's 
been happening in all of the 3 debates. also, what's ''funny'' is there's a 
third candidate that hasn't been allowed to debate with those two clowns 
and his name is gary johnson. just curious...

- - gary johnson for president 2016!😂😂😂

- - check your inner voice first...1 day left!
how many of the american people are aware that there are other candidates 
that you can vote for?
it's sad that gary johnson and jill stein don't even have the opportunity 
to debate!

- - gary johnson anyone?

- - the problem i have with these candidates is their lack of direction and 
overall plan. i will be voting for trump, even though i'd like to vote for 
gary johnson, however he really doesn't stand a chance against crooked 
hillary or the donald. the only hope i see in donald is that i think he 
will actually do more to secure our country's people and build better job 
opportunities for working class citizens. i do not believe hillary has 
shown positive results in her job as secretary of state or before dating 
back to the watergate commission. i would like for these candidates and all 
politicians to pay more attention to people who are hurting in this 
country. that means put more of your dollars in to funding research for 
cures of cancer, and debilitating human conditions. i happen to suffer from 
the most painful condition you could ever get, called cluster headache. its 
bullshit, and i get angry when i see rich bastards soaking up the sun while 
giving nothing in return to the people they make money from.

- - gary johnson is not only a socially liberal but also fiscally conservative. 
best choice out there!!!!

- - the system is rigged because gary johnson and jill stein were not in the 
debates. trump is just a whiney privileged loser who knows he will lose. 
this is the only reason he is saying the election will be rigged against 
him.

2016-12-04-19h-43m-youtube-comments-smkyorC5qwc.csv,stronger together,11.096372898383287,pmi,"- - i think, its a very easy decision.
you have the choice between trump, an unscrupulous businessman and clinton, 
a woman that did some very poor decisions during her life; but she is the 
only chance for america. obama did something wrong, like any other 
president too, cause nobody's perfect, but he did steps into the right 
direction and clinton can expand this. america is stronger together, 
america dont need someone who is trying to divide its people into muslims, 
hispanics and americans. in my country, guns are prohibited and it works 
very well. we dont have a shoot-out in a public school every two months and 
that high amount of firearm deaths. trump wants to keep his citizens safe 
and create prosperity but he denies the gunfact. clinton however tries like 
obama too, to decrease the amount of weapons. in fact, if you elect trump 
for the next 4 years, you have to life with the consequences, and not just 
you, the whole world has to deal with this decision. so, do yourself and 
the world a favor and vote for clinton. reality has no rewind

- - stronger together.
#vote4hillary 
2016 belongs to us. stronger together. trump should run in 2020 or 2024. 
hillary clinton must be our first female president.

- - the current political landscape is cause for me once again to coin the 
general consensus of the american voter and their frustration...
we are fighting a campaign that concedes the reality of, ""[a]s a nation we 
are stronger together in order to adjust and resurrect a robust economy 
nationally"". the republican party has it's agenda based on, ""[w]e gotta 
save the country from those (""stronger together"") voters""; because they are 
causing a massive degree of harm to themselves...
think about it folks and get out and vote for hillary...then turn to your 
republican advocate and give them the finger ""index of coarse"" right to the 
face and say...""get a grip"" we're gonna survive this g.w.bush holocaust if 
you'd just stop panicking!!!

2016-12-04-19h-43m-youtube-comments-smkyorC5qwc.csv,america great again,16.320911455937168,pmi,"- - i will never understand how people can say some of the things being said 
throughout this election. no matter who you choose to vote for, it is not 
right to say any of the candidates should commit suicide or be murdered. it 
is also very silly to assume that world war iii is going to breakout due to 
the results of this election, or that this country is headed towards the 
apocalypse. with that being said though, donald trump is the best candidate 
we could vote for, because otherwise, our country will be worse off. his 
only real competition is hillary clinton, who has proven herself to be a 
crooked and corrupt politician; any third-party candidate currently running 
for president stands no chance of actually winning. 


donald trump is nowhere near as bad as people think he is. despite popular 
belief, he is not going to lead our country into an era of racism, sexism, 
xenophobia, or hate. sure, he has said some pretty offensive things, but 
that just shows that he is an actual person who does not try to be 
politically correct in order to just win the vote. we have all said things 
that we regret or did not mean, and that makes us human. politicians like 
hillary clinton have said things almost as bad as what trump has said, but 
only in private. for example, as much as people like to point to out that 
donald trump has accused president barack obama of being born in kenya, it 
was a clinton employee who first suggested it. according to joshua 
muravchik in “hillary clinton’s bad old days”, “clinton-family retainer 
sidney blumenthal had furnished the material on obama’s past” (34). clinton 
is unreliable and has crooked ways, as she now claims to support obama.


hillary clinton’s corruption as a politician is also demonstrated by the 
way that she can be “bought”. many people believe that she is nothing more 
than a puppet for large corporations and rich people that donate to her 
foundation. as sam frizell points out in “the benefits of friendship with 
hillary clinton”, “half the private individuals whom clinton met with… 
donated to the foundation. that’s 85 out of 154 people” (5). this 
contradicts a clinton quote that frizell also brings to attention, 
“‘democracy can't just be for billionaires’” (6). donald trump is a 
billionaire who worked throughout his life to get to this point, and will 
not be easily bought, as he is not hungry for the money. the same can not 
be said for hillary. 


i understand why so many people are reluctant to give donald trump a 
chance. he’s a loudmouth who lacks political experience, but compared to 
hillary, he is safe. he has proven that he understands the economy with the 
fact that he has done so well, and he has policies that could help our 
country. many people may be put off by what trump has said about some 
things, such as illegal immigrants, and his idea of “building a wall” to 
keep them from coming into the united states. those people just 
misunderstand though, as trump claims in his book crippled america: how to 
make america great again, “i don’t want to stop legal immigration to this 
country. in fact, i would like to reform and increase immigration in some 
important ways” (29). i believe that many of his other policies may be 
misunderstood as well, but in time, if he becomes president, we will see 
that he has what is best for our country in mind. in regard to those voting 
for a third-party candidate, you are just wasting your vote. your 
frustration with both major candidates is understandable, but please think 
about which of them will be better for our country, as you could be making 
a huge mistake by not voting for them. donald trump is not the only the 
most fit candidate for presidency, but perhaps the only fit candidate.

- - i am only 12 years old and this is my only off day and i'm spending my time 
looking at the presidential debate because i really want to understand 
what's going around in my world. people that vote for donald trump are just 
looking about how much money he has and i just probably bribed in some way 
, but hillary clinton will be the perfect person for the job. i don't know 
much about the presidential debate because i am so long but from what i 
hear i think hillary clinton is the best person for the job because she 
gets her point across and she's very thorough about how she will make 
america great again. people like donald trump are business owners and all 
they care about is money now i'm not saying that donald trump is in a good 
person in that doesn't his point across but he doesn't really focus on the 
topic.now you can look at both sides donald trump wants to make it legal 
for anyone to be able to have a gun and he wants to build a wall to reduce 
the amount of immigration. hillary clinton wants back background checks on 
people when they are trying to purchase a gun for our safety as well as for 
kids and she wants to reduce the amount of poverty in america by making 
things more affordable especially when it comes to people that are able to 
afford for their children to go to college. i understand why donald trump 
is coming from when he wants to keep out people that will harm us but it 
still doesn't mean that people that have been here for hundreds and 
hundreds of years they should just go back to somewhere that wasn't either 
comfortable or a good position for their families. hillary clinton wants us 
all to be equal. the presidential debate is really confusing for someone my 
age but the only things that i take out of it is that hillary clinton will 
provide safety and money for people in need and for children. hillary 
clinton is not selfish and cares about others before thinking about 
herself. #hillary clinton 2016

2016-12-04-19h-43m-youtube-comments.csv,mike pence,13.483548143593563,pmi,"- - i love donald trump. i hate hilary cliton! because she is such a liar and 
she didn't deserve to be president. donald trump won the election last 
week, and i'm happy because he and mike pence vice president are going to 
make america great again!

- - to be honest i think mike pence should run for president, because even 
though trump kind of knows what he's doing mike pence would be a better 
option.

- - talking about yourself in the 3d person is a characteristic of anti-social 
personality disorder (narcissism) as is feeling threatened, being unable to 
recognize your faults and shortcomings. and pathological lying (76%, 70 
times in a single speech, or every 5 minutes depending on how you count 
them). saying the president's mother was not in the hospital is an example 
of one such lie--we have seen the guy who was born the same night as obama 
in the same hospital. he remembers his family talking a lot about meeting 
the obama family. 

then we have the newspaper announcement--only the hospital can place those 
announcements. we also saw an interview with a fellow student /teacher at 
the university with obama's parents--it was a big deal that she was 
pregnant there because students did not have babies. then they brought the 
babies to parties. so much proof of his birth in hawaii--yet he never will 
admit he was wrong--he just makes up new lies. 'people pouring over the 
border"" is yet another lie--illegal immigration is net zero--as many leave 
as come. he lies and lies. as is car companies stealing our business--it 
was gm's best year!

that ""unifier"" language is straight out of hitler's m.o.--his last tactic 
after the extreme nationalism, creation of the ""other"" as the ones 
responsible for everything that's wrong in america, the blocking of 
emigration, immigration, the creation of classes of citizenship--certain 
groups must do more and get less, throwing out people with certain beliefs 
(here protected by the constitution), marking people with insignia and even 
tattoos (i heard him suggest tattoos on the faces of muslims), and marking 
their documents with religious affiliation/beliefs. hitler then pivoted to 
becoming the ""unifier"" on the last sunday in january 1933. on tuesday i 
think it was--january 30th, the president appointed him chancellor--he 
never acted as unifier, instead imprisoning communists (the largest 
political faction in the reichstag (legislature) in the first concentration 
camp, dachau. he then built 1 per quarter, then one per month and 
eventually put anyone with a hereditary illness, gypsies, homosexuals, and 
jews inside, once the communists were gone... he transitioned them to slave 
labor camps, then set a 90 day limit on prisoners' usefulness, at which 
point they were scheduled to be dead of starvation, illness, or violence. 
finally, full of jews and eastern europeans, the final solution was 
introduced, expanding techniques long used on mental patients and those 
born with debilitating illnesses to jews and eastern europeans. firing 
squads, gassing... some unifier. 

trump loves authoritarian leaders. people are always shocked by these 
rulers later, but they rarely change their stripes. they telegraph their 
intentions, tactics...they say what they like, write about it. his fans 
should wake-up. i know they hate books, studying, boring things. but grow 
up! the country is not a tv show. go to hollywood, take tours, go to 
tapings! don't elect a tv reality host to the most complex, dangerous, 
powerful position on earth, where even a thoughtless word can cause other 
rulers to invade innocent countries as saddam has kuwait, china has tibet, 
and threatened nepal and india, japan has korea, china and mongolia and 
russia has countless countries, most recently crimea, a region of ukraine. 
russia is not massing tanks on ukraine's border. 

trump is saying he will hire such better employees to vet immigrantsa...but 
look at people he really hires--he can't even stand them more than a few 
months! it's the best example of incompetence. how would a man who never 
had a job in govt, never even worked on a city council, never even won an 
election to run the local dogpound going to suddenly hire the world's 
greatest employees, and specialists in vetting immigrants--requiring 
language abilities, cultural understanding and experience and a huge dose 
of psychology, and the kind of truth and lie identifying, straight out of 
the gate in washington--when his days would be filled with mending fences 
with people who he dissed big time and have no reason to work with him...he 
needs them to approve his cabinet, initiatives, funding, and appointments 
to posts around the world. in addition to the full-time job of crisis 
management, diplomacy, etc. the comparison to reagan ignores the 8 years he 
served running the 7th or 8th largest economy on earth, the many loyal 
people who had worked for him and knew the jobs, knew the boss, knew each 
other. and he had been running for half a decade, planning planning and 
planning, as were people who supported him in the state dept, military, 
congress, the attorney general... trump has zero. zero. 

seriously, chis christie and mike pence (a former radio host after all, not 
an attorney or economist, or even ceo of a big company (these family-run 
tiny businesses like w. and trump run--where trump hires one guy to run 
each hotel and each golf course, waiting for their reports, just do not 
count. trump has no experience hiring on huge levels, managing law 
enforcement, prosecutors and a justice dept, a labor dept, the epa he can't 
even name, the state dept, etc etc. it's not staging contract negotiations 
because you must see these same people year after year after year. and 
trump would have to trust and delegate entire chunks--and we've seen what 
self-serving actions these fools take when they get some power...invading 
iraq looking for fake wmds, without kevlar vests on soldiers, or kevlar 
reinforcing on tanks and trucks. cheney stole everything in the treasury 
for halliburton--his first loyalty, and now he is a multi, multi 
millionaire...people cannot be trusted if you can't review them 
knowledgeably. 

but trump does not know world or american history, does not know the govt, 
the world, its leaders...he really thinks aliens are ""pouring"" over the 
border....and jobs can be brought back--even tho 7 to 9 in every 10 jobs 
lost was lost to mechanization. and now china is losing its jobs to 
mechanization and to other countries who are poorer and can work cheaper 
because they live in grass huts. trump could not learn everything he would 
need to know in a year, if he wanted to, and he has no intellectual 
curiosity! he could not care less. dunning kruger effect magnified for the 
size of his ego.

aleppo, remember the missing e-mails on hillary's side and trump's 'locker 
room' talk. before you say how he blanked and couldn't name a foreign 
leader, remember trump's missing tax returns and hillary defending a child 
who was raped. every candidate has flaws. obviously johnson will not win, 
but that's not why i'm voting for him. i'm voting for him to send a 
message! i want actual candidates to vote for!

hillary's ideas of a higher minimum wage and a debt free college are 
unrealistic. higher minimum wage will only cause inflation and cause the 
value of the us dollar to go down. minimum wage is just that! minimum wage, 
it's for entry level positions such as fast food. you will see higher pay 
if you actually applied yourself. so sit your whining asses down! you're 
not looking or applying yourself hard enough! quit trying to get everything 
handed to you! debt free college is unrealistic. i don't want my tax money 
to go help a student go to college and flunk out of remedial classes 
because they messed up back in high school or where ever they were 
educated. that's unrealistic, which removes jill stein from the equation.

trump's idea on abortion and gay marriage are too old fashioned for the 
america we have today. maybe work on the adoption programs and foster care 
we have in place before worrying about being against abortion. he sounds 
like a complete idiot. he'll run america like a business and not like a 
country. 

that's my opinion (as a current college student working a part-time job 
which technically is on minimum wage but + tips).

- - why would anyone vote for these 2 when we could have jill stein as our 
president????!!!! please get on social media and make a change that you can 
tell your children you where part of!!

- - even jill stein says in a recent interview ""hillary will start nuclear war 
with russia because of her policies."" all other candidates in this election 
are far less dangerous than hillary. this is not main stream news so 
research the facts and spread the news.

will actually do more to secure our country's people and build better job 
opportunities for working class citizens. i do not believe hillary has 
shown positive results in her job as secretary of state or before dating 
back to the watergate commission. i would like for these candidates and all 
politicians to pay more attention to people who are hurting in this 
country. that means put more of your dollars in to funding research for 
cures of cancer, and debilitating human conditions. i happen to suffer from 
the most painful condition you could ever get, called cluster headache. its 
bullshit, and i get angry when i see rich bastards soaking up the sun while

improve mostly the economy, whether it will work or not no one knows 
because he doesnt have any government experience. his tendencies and 
judgement are irratic and if any thing was to go from bad to worse itd be 
with donald because he is a ruthless business person, not a politician. you 
can even tell that he can't even answer half the questions properly; only 
deflecting with hatred and other negative comments about hilarys past.
hilary is a traitor blah blah but at least she has apologized. she also 
knows how to stop and listen which is important if neither of them have 
been a president before... also if bill clinton comes along with hilary how 
do we know he wont have any input in making americas economy good again 
also.
what you all dont see is that pass all the fact checking through these 
debates, donald should only be an economic advisor at best.... to say 
worthy of being a president is beyond ridiculous. 
americans should worry about the people who are voting for trump because i 
would love to hear a rational argument for once.

is coming from when he wants to keep out people that will harm us but it 
still doesn't mean that people that have been here for hundreds and 
hundreds of years they should just go back to somewhere that wasn't either 
comfortable or a good position for their families. hillary clinton wants us 
all to be equal. the presidential debate is really confusing for someone my 
age but the only things that i take out of it is that hillary clinton will 
provide safety and money for people in need and for children. hillary 
clinton is not selfish and cares about others before thinking about 
herself. #hillary clinton 2016
