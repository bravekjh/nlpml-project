Not only does it tell our soldiers that it's alright to objectify and abuse women, but it justifies the broader scope of ""locker room talk"" which the military is already attempting to curtail.

• No handshake surprised everyone I think. I wonder if their campaigns discussed this beforehand.

• Trump looked constipated and defeated from the get-go. Adopted a soft voice but couldn't help himself and settled into his usual aggression early on.

• Return of the sniffing.

• Anderson Cooper and Martha Raddatz came prepared and took no shit.

• A reality TV star dragged up rape claims against a former President in front of his wife and millions of people… and that cut to Bill's shocked face... what a time to be alive.

• So much petulance from Trump about time limits throughout. 

• ""If I were President at that time, [Captain Khan] would have been alive today.""

• Trump's genius military plan to defeat ISIS: ""Make it a sneak attack"".

• Probably the best soundbite of the night: ""Because you'll be in jail"".

• No knockout blow from Hillary but at this point her opponent has already been carried from the ring and is on his way to the morgue. 

• That last question. Name something positive that you respect about your opponent. Amazing.

Trump doesn't really answer questions, spends most of his time being critical of what has happened with no nuance, and when he does lay out something, it's like a jot note in lieu of a plan and it's either to give rich people more money and fewer regulations which will somehow magically benefit the low and middle class, or by creating more competition with those lower taxes prices for stuff will be kept low.

I want to hope that in the next 24 hours of sound bites it'll be very clear that Trump didn't answer a bunch of really important questions, and that he's very much out of his league.

I also am a veteran of Afghanistan and Trump seriously scares me. I posted this elsewhere, but I think that it should be a part of the conversation:

I think that it's important to remember that we are electing the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. For many years(understatement) we have struggled within our military to combat sexual harassment and assault. Even as recently as 2014 our military leaders have [specifically targeted ""what defense officials called 'locker room talk,' because those behaviors show a strong correlation to sexual assault.""](http://thehill.com/policy/defense/195083-military-cracks-down-on-locker-room-talk-at-academies) We need to consider and discuss what the effects of electing a Commander in Chief who makes comments advocating sexual assault, then justifies those remarks as ""locker room talk."" Not only does it tell our soldiers that it's alright to objectify and abuse women, but it justifies the broader scope of ""locker room talk"" which the military is already attempting to curtail. How can you tell a Private in the Army that he can't make sexually aggressive comments when he can go online and see the man at the top of his chain-of-command saying the exact same thing and excusing it as acceptable talk for men-among-men. You can't. The damage is already done and whether he was fit to be President or not, this alone should be enough to consider him unfit.",47,47,0

I think that it's important to remember that we are electing the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces.

Even as recently as 2014 our military leaders have [specifically targeted ""what defense officials called 'locker room talk,' because those behaviors show a strong correlation to sexual assault.""](http://thehill.com/policy/defense/195083-military-cracks-down-on-locker-room-talk-at-academies) We need to consider and discuss what the effects of electing a Commander in Chief who makes comments advocating sexual assault, then justifies those remarks as ""locker room talk."" Not only does it tell our soldiers that it's alright to objectify and abuse women, but it justifies the broader scope of ""locker room talk"" which the military is already attempting to curtail. How can you tell a Private in the Army that he can't make sexually aggressive comments when he can go online and see the man at the top of his chain-of-command saying the exact same thing and excusing it as acceptable talk for men-among-men.

I also am a veteran of Afghanistan and Trump seriously scares me. I posted this elsewhere, but I think that it should be a part of the conversation:

I think that it's important to remember that we are electing the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. For many years(understatement) we have struggled within our military to combat sexual harassment and assault. Even as recently as 2014 our military leaders have [specifically targeted ""what defense officials called 'locker room talk,' because those behaviors show a strong correlation to sexual assault.""](http://thehill.com/policy/defense/195083-military-cracks-down-on-locker-room-talk-at-academies) We need to consider and discuss what the effects of electing a Commander in Chief who makes comments advocating sexual assault, then justifies those remarks as ""locker room talk."" Not only does it tell our soldiers that it's alright to objectify and abuse women, but it justifies the broader scope of ""locker room talk"" which the military is already attempting to curtail. How can you tell a Private in the Army that he can't make sexually aggressive comments when he can go online and see the man at the top of his chain-of-command saying the exact same thing and excusing it as acceptable talk for men-among-men.
