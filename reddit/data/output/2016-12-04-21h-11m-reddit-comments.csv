* Claims that not paying any federal tax makes him smart thereby admitting he doesn't pay any federal tax.

* Claims he will release all his taxes as soon as his audit is finished, followed immediately by claims he has been under audit for 15 years.

* When confronted with accusations that he didn't pay an architect for designing one of his clubhouses he defends it because ""maybe he wasn't happy with the work done"".

* Claims that stop and frisk wasn't ruled unconstitutional, then blames the ruling on an anti-police judge.

* Claims he is not racist because he settled an anti-discrimination lawsuit out of court, and then brags that it was easy to do.

* Claims that he was doing a service to Obama by forcing him to produce his birth certificate.

* Spends 5 minutes on an unstoppable, and fiery, rant about how claims he was a supporter of the invasion of Iraq are wrong, and within 30 seconds of ending claims that he has the best temperament.

* Claims that shooting an Iranian navy ship for taunting US ships wouldn't start a war.

I'm sure there are plenty more but these were the main ones that come to mind. That was an absolute disaster for Trump. He would've been better just not showing up and letting Clinton debate an empty podium.",364,364,0

* Criticizing Clinton for not being polite enough to President Obama during the 2008 Primary Debates

* Congratulating himself for not being as big of an asshole as he could have been (""I could have said some real nasty stuff about Hillary"")

* Claiming that Clinton has been fighting ISIS ""as long as she's been alive"" and seemingly holding her personally accountable for every single bad thing that has happened in the USA in the last 30 years

* Says that China or Iran should take military action against North Korea

* Says that he - the man running for president of the United States - doesn't think very much about NATO, the military alliance that's one of the cornerstones of our foreign policy

* Imploring Lester Holt and the audience to ""call Sean Hannity"" about his support of the Iraq war, as if what he said privately to a fringe-right talk show host is more important than his public statements in favor of the war",19,19,0

Trump made so many flubs and mistakes in the debate. It was pretty hard to keep count. But the biggest one in my opinion was how he buckled down on wanting to blow up an Iranian sailing vessel for taunting us.

TO SHOOT AT ANOTHER VESSEL IS AN ACT OF WAR. That will definitely start a war. And a war with a power that, if they don't currently have nuclear weapons, was at least 2 steps away from having them. 

And we started a [war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish%E2%80%93American_War#USS_Maine) over similar actions. [Twice.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_incident#Consequences)

I also like how he apparently has not commented on Russia doing [similar actions to our naval vessels](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/18/politics/russia-jets-buzz-u-s-ship-rules-of-engagement/) in open waters. And [our airplanes.](http://www.businessinsider.com/ap-navy-boss-russian-jets-should-stop-buzzing-us-planes-ship-2016-5) 

But no, lets start yet another war because of bruised egos. It isn't like [we grandstand all the damn time.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_evil)",27,27,0

• No handshake surprised everyone I think. I wonder if their campaigns discussed this beforehand.

• Trump looked constipated and defeated from the get-go. Adopted a soft voice but couldn't help himself and settled into his usual aggression early on.

• Return of the sniffing.

• Anderson Cooper and Martha Raddatz came prepared and took no shit.

• A reality TV star dragged up rape claims against a former President in front of his wife and millions of people… and that cut to Bill's shocked face... what a time to be alive.

• So much petulance from Trump about time limits throughout. 

• ""If I were President at that time, [Captain Khan] would have been alive today.""

• Trump's genius military plan to defeat ISIS: ""Make it a sneak attack"".

• Probably the best soundbite of the night: ""Because you'll be in jail"".

• No knockout blow from Hillary but at this point her opponent has already been carried from the ring and is on his way to the morgue. 

• That last question. Name something positive that you respect about your opponent. Amazing.

Not only does it tell our soldiers that it's alright to objectify and abuse women, but it justifies the broader scope of ""locker room talk"" which the military is already attempting to curtail. How can you tell a Private in the Army that he can't make sexually aggressive comments when he can go online and see the man at the top of his chain-of-command saying the exact same thing and excusing it as acceptable talk for men-among-men.

I think that it's important to remember that we are electing the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces.

Even as recently as 2014 our military leaders have [specifically targeted ""what defense officials called 'locker room talk,' because those behaviors show a strong correlation to sexual assault.""](http://thehill.com/policy/defense/195083-military-cracks-down-on-locker-room-talk-at-academies) We need to consider and discuss what the effects of electing a Commander in Chief who makes comments advocating sexual assault, then justifies those remarks as ""locker room talk."" Not only does it tell our soldiers that it's alright to objectify and abuse women, but it justifies the broader scope of ""locker room talk"" which the military is already attempting to curtail. How can you tell a Private in the Army that he can't make sexually aggressive comments when he can go online and see the man at the top of his chain-of-command saying the exact same thing and excusing it as acceptable talk for men-among-men.

I think that it's important to remember that we are electing the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. For many years(understatement) we have struggled within our military to combat sexual harassment and assault. Even as recently as 2014 our military leaders have [specifically targeted ""what defense officials called 'locker room talk,' because those behaviors show a strong correlation to sexual assault.""](http://thehill.com/policy/defense/195083-military-cracks-down-on-locker-room-talk-at-academies) We need to consider and discuss what the effects of electing a Commander in Chief who makes comments advocating sexual assault, then justifies those remarks as ""locker room talk."" Not only does it tell our soldiers that it's alright to objectify and abuse women, but it justifies the broader scope of ""locker room talk"" which the military is already attempting to curtail. How can you tell a Private in the Army that he can't make sexually aggressive comments when he can go online and see the man at the top of his chain-of-command saying the exact same thing and excusing it as acceptable talk for men-among-men.

We would here about body cameras, carbon caps, and entitlement reform like they were nothing.

United States Senator from New York

She worked with fellow members of the United States Senate to make some change but she has no ability to act unilaterally.

United States Secretary of State
2009-2013
Under direct command from Barack Obama but has some major power to enact change on a Geopolitical level.

So she had no real power until she became a U.S. Senator in 2001 which halves Trump's claim. On a global stage she only had real power for four years while being under the command of the POTUS. ",24,24,0

I liked it a bit though, because I thought it cut to a lot of issues that GOP/Conservative voters have with Hillary and Trump, and while it should've helped Trump by being more in his supposed 'sweet spot', it was such an incoherent, rambling mess most the time, it completely eliminated the advantage.  Conversely, it gave Clinton an opportunity to really face the 'tough' questions and hammer home solid answers (though she certainly pivoted from a few questions I think we all would've liked some more direct answers to).

In total, I think the debate was a microcosm of what (some of) Fox News and mainstream conservatives feel about Trump and the election - they don't like Clinton, but they know Trump is an asshat and a terrible choice.

Whether she means to act on her promises or not, Hillary really acted like a leader and gave a message of inclusion and unity. Trump started his statement with an attack, then continued to fear monger and advocate more division in our society. As an undecided voter, I think this debate settled my indecision.

Also shoutout to Chris Wallace. Very professional moderator who was able to keep reasonable control over the debate and who tried his best to focus on real campaign issues. 

*Edit: I should clarify that I was undecided in the sense that I hadn't made my final decision until tonight.

His rhetoric is dangerous. Words have power, and as much as people hate the it, Donald Trump has significant support amongst a good percentage of voters. This incendiary rhetoric cannot be tolerated as it undermines the foundations of our democracy.

All I can say is that I hope the American people saw the enormous disparities between the two candidates tonight. Just as in the two previous presidential debates beforehand, it is clear that these two candidates have not only two very different ideas of American progress, but two very different realities.

I liked it a bit though, because I thought it cut to a lot of issues that GOP/Conservative voters have with Hillary and Trump, and while it should've helped Trump by being more in his supposed 'sweet spot', it was such an incoherent, rambling mess most the time, it completely eliminated the advantage.  Conversely, it gave Clinton an opportunity to really face the 'tough' questions and hammer home solid answers (though she certainly pivoted from a few questions I think we all would've liked some more direct answers to).

In total, I think the debate was a microcosm of what (some of) Fox News and mainstream conservatives feel about Trump and the election - they don't like Clinton, but they know Trump is an asshat and a terrible choice.  I thought Wallace did a service by giving questions that allowed Clinton to really speak directly to the fears of moderate conservatives, and really make her case as being a perfectly acceptable and reasonable candidate for President - not this crazy boogie man that the alt-right and hardliners have...trumped...her up to be.

If the Republicans had actually nominated a semi-serious candidate, we would probably be having some very sharp and revealing policy discussion where Clinton and this imaginary Republican go toe to toe on where economic growth comes from, how to untangle Syria, and what can be done to improve race relations. We would here about body cameras, carbon caps, and entitlement reform like they were nothing.

I liked it a bit though, because I thought it cut to a lot of issues that GOP/Conservative voters have with Hillary and Trump, and while it should've helped Trump by being more in his supposed 'sweet spot', it was such an incoherent, rambling mess most the time, it completely eliminated the advantage.  Conversely, it gave Clinton an opportunity to really face the 'tough' questions and hammer home solid answers (though she certainly pivoted from a few questions I think we all would've liked some more direct answers to).

In total, I think the debate was a microcosm of what (some of) Fox News and mainstream conservatives feel about Trump and the election - they don't like Clinton, but they know Trump is an asshat and a terrible choice.  I thought Wallace did a service by giving questions that allowed Clinton to really speak directly to the fears of moderate conservatives, and really make her case as being a perfectly acceptable and reasonable candidate for President - not this crazy boogie man that the alt-right and hardliners have...trumped...her up to be.

Clinton's biggest strength as a politician who is a major policy hawk, well read on every issue to an insane level, who usually doesn't give the time of day to anything else. Her main problem is that she doesn't really care about stuff like using private email servers, and she has had to study a lot on how to do the traditional bloviating politician shtick.

If the Republicans had actually nominated a semi-serious candidate, we would probably be having some very sharp and revealing policy discussion where Clinton and this imaginary Republican go toe to toe on where economic growth comes from, how to untangle Syria, and what can be done to improve race relations. We would here about body cameras, carbon caps, and entitlement reform like they were nothing.

Instead, we get this shit. Clinton is one of the smartest people out there and will be a much better President than she is a campaigner. If the GOP thinks they will have an easy time in 2020 they are in for a surprise.",97,97,0

I liked it a bit though, because I thought it cut to a lot of issues that GOP/Conservative voters have with Hillary and Trump, and while it should've helped Trump by being more in his supposed 'sweet spot', it was such an incoherent, rambling mess most the time, it completely eliminated the advantage.  Conversely, it gave Clinton an opportunity to really face the 'tough' questions and hammer home solid answers (though she certainly pivoted from a few questions I think we all would've liked some more direct answers to).

In total, I think the debate was a microcosm of what (some of) Fox News and mainstream conservatives feel about Trump and the election - they don't like Clinton, but they know Trump is an asshat and a terrible choice.  I thought Wallace did a service by giving questions that allowed Clinton to really speak directly to the fears of moderate conservatives, and really make her case as being a perfectly acceptable and reasonable candidate for President - not this crazy boogie man that the alt-right and hardliners have...trumped...her up to be.
