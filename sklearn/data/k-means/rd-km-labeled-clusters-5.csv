0,0,Check out the fresh megathread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/54or5a/2016_presidential_race_first_presidential/).
1,1,Remember when Trump admitted that he hasn't paid any taxes at all? Lol.
2,3,"and then claimed it's good business

i'm amazed he has any support since most of his support is poor and middle class white men, the exact people who get screwed when the rich don't pay taxes"
3,3,"It's because he's smart.  And wanting the real estate market to dive in 2006 was just good business.

Oh, and 'Bigly.'"
4,0,"https://twitter.com/jerryspringer/status/780601736327208960

lol"
5,3,400-pound computer hackers!
6,3,There goes that Reddit vote.
7,3,"Considering how popular Fat People Hate was, there's at least a portion who's sticking around."
8,3,That's the voat vote. 
9,2,Chris Christie. As it was said on CBCNN.
10,1,"After 90 minutes of a political debate, I know more about the locations of Trump's properties than I do about his policies."
11,2,"That whole tangent about how he built a resort in Palm Beach or whatever so he can't be racist made so little sense it made my head spin. He just tries to shoe horn in bullshit to make him seem successful at every possible opportunity. And then he said Palm Beach was the wealthiest place in the world, which is not even close, it's not even in the top 100 wealthiest places in the US. Trump loves to exaggerate his wealth and apparently everybody else's too. I don't believe for a second he's actually a billionaire. "
12,1,"Trump on CNN says he's proud that he didn't bring up Bill Clinton's infidelities.

What is happening."
13,3,"A guy who cheated on his first wife, married his mistress, then divorced her, and is currently on wife #3. He really is stunning in his lack of self awareness. "
14,2,"So far in this election cycle, Trump has been caught redhanded doing the exact things he's been accusing Hillary of doing. Hes the king of projection. Makes me think he is having some serious health issues himself."
15,4,My favorite was when he basically told Hilary that she wasn't nice. Like... has he heard anything he's said in the past year?
16,3,Well keep in mind he's also very proud that he started an establishment in Palm Beach that allowed black people.
17,1,Trump is happy with himself that he had the restraint not to mention Bill's infidelity. Just now on CNN.
18,2,"Hillary would've responded ""says the man on his third wife"""
19,3,"""... who had infamously cheated on his first wife.""

IIRC, he cheated on his second wife too but it was certainly big news when he cheated on his first because he married the woman he had the affair with (a young model) shortly after divorcing his wife who was a celebrity herself."
20,3,How can he possibly think bringing up that is a GOOD tactic??! 
21,2,"ya that comment was gross.  said he had some bad things to say about bill clinton, and that hes proud he held back, but maybe youll see at the 2nd debate.  dude is trailer park trash."
22,3,">we have to move on

>WE HAVE TO MOVE ON

>WE HAVE TO MOVE ON

Poor Lester"
23,4,They need to cut mics. Enforce time limits and treat them like children if they need to.
24,3,YES. Why did they not cut off the microphones during their 2 minute speeches? The media didn't want the debate; they wanted the entertainment.
25,3,The candidates would never agree to it.
26,2,"""Please only 20 seconds"" is the funniest thing that was said all night"
27,3,"We can all agree that Trump won the black vote, I hear they love stop and frisk."
28,3,I had to just break out in laughter at that point. Question is about black inequality and says he supports stop and frisk.  Forget about if he's right or not that it will help black communities. Just the fact that he actually thought he would be able to **gain black support** by endorsing **stop and frisk** of all things shows the immeasurable disconnect he has with the black community.
29,2,"When he said this in response to bridging the racial devide I was stunned, actually stunned. Voices went all charlie browns parents for a moment as I let that moment sink in... it's one of the most out of touch responses I've seen... It almost has comedic timing with how confidently it defies comprehension."
30,3,"I didn't think he could do anything to give Clinton more of the black vote, but Stop and Frisk was struck down as Unconstitutional for a reason. He's just so out of touch...."
31,3,My understanding is that he is out of touch on all levels. He should have stayed in the shadows and continued to pay politicians to do his bidding. He would have had auch better shot at having influence and power in government. 
32,3,He's not trying to gain the black vote; it's more dog whistling to his white base.
33,3,"Well he's built very, very good relationships with them over............the last little while. "
34,3,"Yeah, the people in the Harlem bar where I was watching--you know, the ones actually subjected to it--applauded that part. They also loved hearing that they couldn't walk in their own neighborhood without getting shot. (/s for anyone who needs it)"
35,3,"Poor Sean Hannity, nobody ever calls him.  :("
36,3,"> AC on CNN:

> Don't you want someone as President who thinks carefully about the words they say? 

THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS WE ARE ASKING AT THIS POINT."
37,4,"""We don't know who broke into the DNC... Russia? China? Maybe that 4-Chan guy? He weighs like 400 lbs I heard. btw My son is 10 years old. He's good with computers. We have to do better Lester, and the cyber is one of them."""
38,2,"Even funnier, I think he just said ""cyber"", without the security part, similar to what he did with ""nuclear"" later on."
39,3,Well what do you expect? Cyber is a very bigly problem.  /s
40,3,Security is the most important part of Cyber.
41,3,Lol that bit with his son went nowhere
42,3,"One of ""those"" guys that thinks everyone good with a computer is 400 pounds."
43,1,"Lol at Trump on CNN:

*The polls showed that we did great*

*There hasn't been a poll in yet, Mr. Trump*"
44,3,A lot of people have told him how well he did. 
45,3,*Very smart* people
46,3,And they told him! 
47,2,"And they said, they said to him:"
48,3,"You did a great, a really tremendous job. Believe me, folks!"
49,3,Which polls?
50,3,all of them
51,3,Says who?
52,2,I just said. All of them.
53,3,"ok, and your question is?"
54,3,"Honest question here: did Donald basically call for an international protection racket? ""We should only protect countries that pay up"""
55,3,"Yes, that is the entire backbone of his foreign policy. "
56,3,"It would be a shame if anything happened to you, Poland."
57,1,Fox News is even saying Trump performed poorly.
58,3,"Liberal MSM and their BIAS speaking, here!

/s"
59,3,"If it ain't Breitbart ^^^or ^^^Stormfront, it's the biased MSM!"
60,3,"They've never really liked him, and four more Democrat years would be a ratings bonanza."
61,0,"""This was not a normal debate.""

Damn straight."
62,3,"""This is the most abnormal event I have ever witnessed on television"""
63,3,"I dunno, one time the Seahawks passed when they should have run."
64,3,This other time they caught a touchdown that was actually an interception.
65,2,"He said Hillary was ""over-prepared."" That's such a stupid thing to say. "
66,0,"[deleted]  
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.4171 
 > [What is this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/33245)"
67,1,Trump is the guy that makes fun of the smart kid for doing his homework
68,2,He basically just told everyone else that Hillary was prepared and he had no idea what he was doing
69,2,"i mean what do you expect from the guy who said he'd first strike Iran

does this fucking idiot not realize his words have consequences?"
70,0,"[Hillary Clinton listening to Donald Trump answer birther questions](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CtU5ElJWcAIjQoS.jpg:large)

[Source](https://twitter.com/AnnTelnaes)"
71,3,"""Never interrupt your enemy while he is making a mistake."""
72,3,"Trump is going to create a new cabinet position called ""Secretary of The Cyber"" and he's going to appoint his 10 year old son. He's so good with computers it's unbelievable."
73,3,Bar was so low he tripped on it
74,3,"Did he admit to not paying taxes or did I imagine that?
"
75,2,"Not only that, but he said ""that makes me smart"""
76,3,"""9 million people lost their jobs""

""Yeah, it's called business""

wut

Edit: Thanks for the gold"
77,3,"""If Iran taunts us we'll blow them up"""
78,3,"""That would start a war""

""No it wouldn't""

Complete idiot."
79,3,"""Stop and frisk was unconstitutional because of racism""

""THESE ARE BAD PEOPLE!!"""
80,3,"Yet the alt right and all his supporters are quick to criticize the left about ""hurt feelings"" and pc culture. 

""You insult me?! You must die!"""
81,3,"Not even the government of Iran, but some 20 year old idiots on a boat. He wants to start wars that cost trillions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of lives over sailors talking shit."
82,2,"I mean I'm not surprised that he's such a big baby

I bet he would nuke the whole Middle East if a single government official in Pakistan said something bad about him (yes, I know Pakistan isn't in the Middle East, but Trump sure as shit doesn't)"
83,0,I think that line is going to be replayed ad nauseam for the next couple of days until the next debate
84,3,"I think the profiting from he housing crisis as being ""good business"" or ""smart business"" or whatever he said is going to be the takeaway

Edit: http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-on-rooting-for-housing-crisis-thats-called-business-2016-09-26 -- that's what I'm talking about"
85,3,"or the fucking comment on the first strike

or how he had nothing to say on race relations but ""we need law and order"" and his promotion of stop and frisk"
86,3,"He basically admitted to not paying taxes, not paying staff and contractors, etc. What a mess. "
87,0,"Not only that, he compounded it when later in the debate he talked about nations in NATO  not paying their fair share, under treaty, under contract. Does he realize the contradiction?"
88,1,"If cornered, his campaign (probably Conway, I don't know if Trump will actually answer) will respond by saying that it's showing that they're smart to take advantage of us. 

We've been ""dumb"" so far by letting them do so. 

(Not my views, just how I anticipate them responding)"
89,2,Kinda cracked up when Donald said Hillary wasn't nice to her.
90,2,The weird part was when he said he was gonna say something really disrespectful toward Hillary and her family but decided not to cause he realized it was mean. 
91,3,"What a good kind hearted person. He would blow up Iran, stop and frisk people, but he wouldn't dare insult Hillary with whatever it was. What a man."
92,0,Reminded me of the Parks and Recs debate.
93,0,[This one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7EA6agX-g&feature=youtu.be&t=10)
94,1,Donald Trump is a boy
95,3,"""Guys, she's being mean to me!"" ;_;"
96,1,"I love how the majority of her ""attack ads"" are just videos and sound clips of Trump talking. He writes his own attack ads. She should be thanking him for doing all that hard work for her."
97,3,"""She's been running hundreds of millions of dollars worth of ads attacking me!""

The ads are literally footage from his own rallies. That says something that he considers barely edited repurposed campaign footage to be an insult to him."
98,0,"This onion article will never not be relevant.

Truly prophetic. "
99,4,I felt like I just watched Eric Cartman debate for 90 minutes. 
100,3,Cartman is more articulate.
101,3,Cartman is also smarter. 
102,3,disturbingly accurate. 
103,3,Respect my authoritehh!!
104,3,Cartman is more eloquent 
105,3,Can't wait for the Southpark episode on this!
106,1,"For those of you that experienced your first Presidential Debate, that was not how it usually is. Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, while terse with each other, kept it respectable and policy/information-driven.

Donald Trump is what happens when you let someone with no real experience up on the main stage - a lot of banal, uncomfortable moments. I'm disgusted that this is what it's gotten to."
107,2,"I appreciate this. First year I registered to vote, and the first time I have seen a presidential debate. Even with that said, I knew it would go this way with Trump's demeanor. "
108,1,*Trump's temperament 
109,3,"Every time I wonder what people in other countries think about this shit show of an election, I become embarrassed."
110,3,"Oh, we of other countries don't look at this election so scornfully or mockingly, but rather in shock and disbelief. Either the majority of the US voters has lost  their rootin tootin minds or the US has ceased being a functional democracy. Both scenarios are grim :/"
111,3,"Thank you, I'm young and that was a useful perspective-check."
112,3,"I'd recommend watching either the '08 or '12 debates, then weep at what democracy has lost."
113,0,"I like the combo of debate 1 and 2 of '12. It shows Obama getting beat pretty handedly but still staying composed. Then regrouping and  having a great showing in the second debate. 

Trump was crushed in this debate but somehow I doubt he will learn from it, work hard to prepare for the next one, and come out ready to battle."
114,1,"I think there is a very good discussion to be had over the role of the government.

But that is not what we received here tonight from Trump. Other elections are much much better."
115,4,It's so fucking crazy. I honestly though Mitt sounded like a crazy robot during his debates and cringed at half of his stuff (binders full of women). But now...now Romney seems like serious candidate. 
116,1,"Romney was rich and somewhat disconnected, but he was largely a normal person with proper manners. Trump doesn't have any manners at all. No sense of what constitutes polite discourse. "
117,3,"Holy shit. Did Trump argue that we need stop and frisk across America, as in, the Police can stop anyone one of us without cause, and fondle us to search for illegal items for no reason? How can anyone in favor of liberty and freedom agree with that?"
118,3,"No, no, you misunderstand. That's just for *inner city folk*. You know... *Urban people*. \*wink*"
119,2,Still can't believe he said she's been fighting ISIS her entire adult life
120,3,I don't even know what he was trying to say with that. It was a total non-sequitur. 
121,3,"I still liked, ""I can deal with cybersecurity because, look i have a 10 year old son, he's great with computers, you wouldn't even believe.""
 
Ok......"
122,3,"Imagine the confusion of being that kid right now. 

""What does he mean? Am I in charge of cyber intelligence now? Wtf dad?"""
123,3,This kid can make a minecraft house in ten minutes. Obviously the best at what he does
124,1,"CNN's Trump supporters are pulling out ""well, of course she looked better, she was probably off practicing every week.""

That is the strangest insult I've ever heard."
125,3,Nerd!!!! I mean do we really want someone who is smart and does their own research about the issues? I want someone I can drink a beer with God dammit!!!!!
126,4,"Just like basically every criticism of Hillary. If there's something good to say about her, then its really bad somehow."
127,4,It's almost like it's important to prepare for a debate in front of millions. 
128,3,Political fact checkers will earn their pay checks tonight.
129,3,"They're getting overtime for sure, no ones sleeping tonight. "
130,2,"My favorite quote by far:

""Donald said he would blow those sailors out of the water. That is not the right temperament, to be... Taunted"" - Hillary

""No, *they* were taunting *us*."" - Donald

So SO much irony to that one. "
131,1,"Trump tonight:

http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/sometimes-i-start-a-sentence.jpg"
132,3,"Didn't he say something about ""No it won't"" when Hilary mention that it would start a war by bombing the sailors?

I hope I didn't hear it wrong, beacuse I laughed so much xD"
133,3,"Yes. Yes he did. As if major conflicts, world wars even, were never started as the result of one nations firing on another's warships or transports.

Edit: words n' stuff"
134,3,Oh yeah!  Absolutely fucking unreal.  
135,1,"Remember the gulf of Tonkin incident?

Trump doesn't. "
136,3,"Listen, trust me. We have to assisnate Franz Ferdinand. It totally won't start a war. Trust me."
137,3,"Come now.  When has attacking a boat ever started a war lol


(You know, other than America in WW1, Spanish American war, Pearl Harbor, War of 1812, and Vietnam). "
138,3,"""That wouldn't start a war"" WTF attacking another country would clearly start a war. "
139,4,"Oh please.   The United States of America has only gone to war like, three, *maybe* four times tops, due to a civilian ship being destroyed by a foreign government. 

(It's something like that right? I'm a Canadian but there was that Spanish war ship, the Lusitania for WWI, was Gulf of Tonkin a civilian ship?, and I feel like I'm missing some big one somewhere)."
140,3,"Never thought I'd see ""Stop and Frisk"" DEFENDED on television... But here we are"
141,3,When Mr Bigly told the moderator that Stop and Frisk wasn't ruled unconsitutional I laughed for a minute and then sighed deeply.
142,4,He was told it was unconstitutional... then KEPT ON using it as his main policy proposal. That was like Marco Rubio levels of rote memorization with no thinking on his feet.
143,3,"Not to mention him trying to deny that the murder rate in NYC continued to decline past 500/yr. It literally took me 30 seconds to look that up and prove he was lying: http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_statistics/cs-en-us-city.pdf

I'm honestly trying to be open to his ideas but he just keeps spewing so much bullshit it's hard to take anything he says seriously."
144,3,As a response to a question about race relations.  
145,4,"I feel like we should be relieved that Hillary outclassed Trump every way in policy, ideology, and temperament, but I'm not sure the American electorate is cognizant enough of reality to accept this debate for what it was"
146,1,my mom is a hardcore trump supporter but acknowledged his performance as terrible before turning it off early. lol
147,2,"I think people like a winner. If the narrative in the media is that Trump lost, people who don't follow politics closely will begin to see Hillary as the inevitable winner and next president. Debates are never about specifics on the macro level. They are about momentum, and right now Hillary has it all. "
148,1,"Mod: stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional

Trump: I own property in Chicago "
149,3,"What about the violence in Charlotte?

I own property there, too."
150,0,[deleted]
151,2,"Yes it was.  He also said he didn't pay any federal tax ""because I'm smart"".
"
152,2,Before this he even said he was smart for avoiding paying taxes.
153,1,What was up at the end there? Trump just leaves while Clinton greets the crowd lol
154,3,"Best bit was Donald frothing at the mouth, after several minutes of incomprehensible rhetoric about nuclear, screaming I HAVE THE BEST TEMPERAMENT!!"
155,3,How many times did Hannity orgasm hearing his name mentioned over and over again?
156,2,"""Hillary did very mean things, it was very mean.""
"
157,3,"""Not nice!""

At least he'll get the toddler vote"
158,1,"""I don't know. Maybe. Who knows. Essentially."" - Donald J. Trump"
159,1,"When she accurately made the correlation that Trump's tax avoidance affected Veterans and other Americans in need of tax dollars.. It framed him as a self-ish narcisist, and complete liar. "
160,1,"""We have so many things we need to do better, and certainly cyber is one of them."" - Donald Trump"
161,1,"Clinton ate his lunch. He was visibly upset at numerous points. When Hillary is the one looking at ease and getting the crowd to laugh, you're in deep shit. 

Nearly everything right

-Acknowledged emails were a mistake and moved on. 

-Didn't pull a Gore and get too wonky

-Demonstrated command of facts

-Crushed Trump on birtherism, taxes, stiffing the working man, and terrifying out allies

-Had great responses to him mocking her preparing for debates and her ""stamina"".
"
162,3,I think Trump was more of his own worse enemy. Getting into the birther thing and the Rosie thing he should of just moved on instead of going into those.
163,3,"He can't help himself, he's so fucking petty - temperamentally unfit for office. "
164,3,"That's not true, he has the best temperament. A winning temperament. "
165,4,Didn't he say something like we all agree Rosie deserved it? 
166,3,She should have pointed out how making corporations stay in the country is technically a regulation.
167,1,"The smartest decision was not even saying anything about Trump's Sanders comment. 

"
168,2,"He went from calling her Secy. Clinton to just Hillary.  She definitely got under his skin, but then agsin, it's so very thin, it was expected. "
169,1,I truly don't understand how anyone outside of already diehard Trump supporters could think that he won. I don't believe Hillary did fantastic by any means but Trump couldn't even string together a coherent point.
170,0,what is the purpose of the audience in a debate.. It's just meaningless interruption 
171,3,Usually they are asked to stay silent so they are a non-factor.  I think its mostly for show 
172,3,They were asked to stay silent. They just didn't.
173,2,"One of the parts that stood out most to me was when Hillary said something along the lines of ""By the end of the night, I will be blamed with almost everything that has gone badly"", and Donald responded with ""Why not?"". And Hillary repeated ""Why not"" very sarcastically. It really showed how out of touch with reality Donald and the rest of the alt right really is."
174,4,"I loved how sarcastic Hillary got. It was fantastic. I wanted ice queen Clinton to show up to the debate, but I think I actually like aloof, no-fucks-given, sarcastic Clinton more."
175,3,"Her ""it's a good line"" was fucking fantastic. "
176,2,"The amount of times Trump said ""I never said that"" when he clearly did just blows my mind. How is he even a candidate? He literally had a quote thrown at him and he tried to change what he said on live television!"
177,3,"he denied his comments on global warming, on women and black people, on the Iraq war, on Libya, and all of those are so easily verified

the only people who think he won or got anything other than annihilated are idiots on /r/the_donald who refuse to fact check "
178,3,Wrong /s
179,4,"He won the debate for her. When the moderator says you made a comment, you better be pretty sure before you challenge it. Chances are you'll look like an idiot."
180,3,Especially when you start arguing with a black man about the racist policies that were Stop and Frisk.  
181,3,"I was only listening to it on NPR, didn't know he was black. That makes it much more interesting."
182,1,"Yea, Lester Holt, the moderator, is a black man.  And he's a registered republican.  So it was especially fascinating when Trump accused him last week of being a democrat.  But then even more fascinating was that his campaign defended this error by saying that Trump didn't know that Holt was a republican, which of course begs the question as to how did Trump assume that Holt was a democrat? Because he's black? "
183,3,because his supporters are goldfish with no memory or motivation to look it up and just believe him when he says he didn't say those things 
184,3,"This is patently false. Goldfish have perfectly average memory capabilities, and can even differentiate their owners/caretakers from other humans."
185,3,"My apologies to goldfish, lets say I was referring to the healthy cracker snack"
186,3,This makes me embarrassed for ever being a republican. 
187,4,I felt like I was watching the kid who had two weeks of study time go head to head with the kid who crammed 30 minutes before the test. 
188,2,"Hillary saying that yes, she did prepare for the debate, ""and I also prepared to become President of the United States"" was savage."
189,3,That was the knock-out punch.  Everything after that was him trying to get back up. 
190,3,One liner of the whole night for sure
191,4,I think it's more like the teacher vs a kid whose cheat notes written on his hand got smudged.
192,1,White lady on CNN just told Van Jones that Trump's message to black people was effective tonight.
193,3,"""I have nothing better to offer you"" was pretty loud and clear."
194,3,"If there's one thing black people love most, it's being unconstitutionally stopped and searched by police officers simply because of their skin color.

They're also on board with Iran invading North Korea, I heard."
195,3,It was definitely the shitshow it was hyped up to be. 10 out of fucking 10.
196,4,"I'd also like to remind everyone that Donald Trump all but admitted he doesn't pay taxes.

A self proclaimed billionaire who spent a part of the debate complaining about how we don't have money to pay for infrastructure pays no taxes, and he thought that was an accolade to be proud of. "
197,3,"On top of that, he's also touting the biggest tax cut in history.  So, how exactly will we be fixing that infrastructure?

"
198,0,[deleted]
199,3,"Don't forget that he responded an accusation of taking advantage of the 2008 crisis to rip off people with ""it's business"". So not only is he proud of cheating taxes, he's also proud of making his money at the expense of others. "
200,1,"Is trump really doing what I think he's doing?

Using ""private conversations"" with Sean hannity of all people as evidence that he was against the Iraq war? That is just absurd. I'll bet these conversations never happened and he just threw out Sean's name because he's willing to comply and lie in order to help trump. This guy gets paid handsomely to suck off trump and spout bullshit for the GOP.

Not that I know any of this as fact, I just doubt hannity and trump had much of a relationship back then"
201,0,[This debate summed up] (http://i.imgur.com/ueIbHTc.jpg)
202,1,"As an independent, at the beginning of the election season, I was rooting for Trump. I really wanted something different for our country and always believed that a businessman at the helm will make it better for the little people. But at this point, fuck that, I will wait for someone else. It just cannot be Trump. Too risky."
203,0,[deleted]
204,2,This is the statement that will define why Hillary wins in November.
205,4,I thought Hillary was going to bomb this but she actually looked presidential. I was thinking Trump was going to command the stage (in a good way) but he lost... Especially at the birther and stop and frisk. Dude harassing people (studies indicate mostly minorities) so you feel better is NOT ok. It would be like turning the cops into TSA agents and letting them loose on the street. 
206,3,[removed]
207,3,Nothing will lose him their vote.
208,3,"""hey guys he gave us a shout out"""

210,3,Because they're not old enough to vote.
211,3,Cheetos were spilled.  
212,2,I absolutely lost my shit when he said that.
213,4,That's also like half of /pol/
214,3,I just did a Peter Lorre laugh
215,2,"I posted this in response to another comment, but want to unbury it because I see lots of similar comments:

I think Trump should get grilled when he offers half-assed, nonsense responses that completely stray from the question. Someone in here said the moderator is a registered republican, so there's that too. Hillary was prepared, Donald was not. Donald was rude, disrespectful, and at times full of total BS. That may be why it looked like he got grilled."
216,4,">Donald was rude, disrespectful, and at times full of total BS. 

Kind of like how he's been for his entire campaign."
217,0,"> Fox's Megyn Kelly: ""We have Trump speaking to our own Sean Hannity. Let's see if he speaks to any of the journalists in the room.""

https://twitter.com/dfriedman33/status/780600035788595200"
218,4,It was like an awful SNL skit that wouldn't end.
219,4,"What in the fuck was Trump talking about at times, like it literally had fuck all to do with anything."
220,3,His birther arguments were complete gibberish. No idea what he was saying. 
221,2,omfg that last question where he started ranting about maga and then just said that he'd support her lmao
222,2,"It was pretty much what I expected. Trump would try to hide the fact he has little knowledge, but wouldn't be able to because of the one-on-one and the extra time. He wisely stayed away from ""Crooked Hillary"", but his sighs (remember Al Gore?) and constant interjections looked bad.

That last weird bit about ""I could say something mean but I won't"" did not make you look good Donald. "
223,0,[deleted]
224,3,"You could just tell how happy she was to have a chance to say that. Someone else guessed that every time she smiled while donald talked, she had already prepared a counterpoint, and I think they were right."
225,3,"Can you even imagine being her and hearing such horrible sexist shit about why you're unfit to be president? You don't look the part, you're mentally incompetent, etc... Glad she was able to respond to that garbagw"
226,4,she spent his time talking either smiling or looking like [this](http://67.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mb8x9iiu8q1rbzx9io2_1280.jpg)
227,0,For real. Dude can't even do a 90 minute debate
228,3,The cocaine was wearing off towards the end and he was just getting cranky. 
229,3,"It's clearly Adderall, but yeah."
230,3,He's a creature of the 80s. I don't really think he was on coke but it wouldn't surprise me if he was because he felt he needed that old reliable boost. 
231,3,"He petered out about halfway through. It was quite amusing, you could see him get tired and frustrated."
232,3,"She did drop some sick burns tonight, not gonna lie. I don't support either of them, but man that was just wow."
233,3,that and the tweet quote were strong ones
234,4,"She definitely used her best zingers, like a greatest hits. That one, and ""the only secret is he has no plan.""  Hopefully her team comes up with new ones for the next debate. I agree with Trump that it's getting old almost as much as I agree with Hillary that it's a good one."
235,1,"Clinton basically apologising the world for Trump was actually funny, but him saying America shouldn't be a world police is also smart, but then he rambled forever"
236,4,"Well, with the debate ending, holy shit. I think Trump started off okay, but as time went on he seemed to really come unraveled. By the end I felt like I was watching a murder with the whole ""Ms. Piggy"" thing."
237,3,Hopefully undecideds watched the whole thing 
238,3,We did! We're decided now.
239,3,I did. And now I'm not.

 > [What is this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/57407)"
241,2,"Yeah, the opening handshake was good.  Then he greeted Hillary, and it was all downhill from there."
242,2,"Condescendingly asking if he could call her Secretary Clinton, and then using the word secretary in a seemingly pejorative sense throughout the debate made me angry. But Hillary's constant calm, earnest and cool attitude settled me down."
243,1,"Listen, I am as luke-warm about Hillary as anyone but can we please put the whole ""she doesn't discuss policy, it's all about I'm not Trump"" shit to bed? She seemed to be making a concerted effort to keep it about specific policy while Trump regurgitated his ""Make America Great Again"" and ""It is all China's fault"" rants."
244,1,"So some of my personal highlights from Trump's dumpster fire performance:

* Claims that not paying any federal tax makes him smart thereby admitting he doesn't pay any federal tax.

* Claims he will release all his taxes as soon as his audit is finished, followed immediately by claims he has been under audit for 15 years.

* When confronted with accusations that he didn't pay an architect for designing one of his clubhouses he defends it because ""maybe he wasn't happy with the work done"".

* Claims that stop and frisk wasn't ruled unconstitutional, then blames the ruling on an anti-police judge.

* Claims he is not racist because he settled an anti-discrimination lawsuit out of court, and then brags that it was easy to do.

* Claims that he was doing a service to Obama by forcing him to produce his birth certificate.

* Spends 5 minutes on an unstoppable, and fiery, rant about how claims he was a supporter of the invasion of Iraq are wrong, and within 30 seconds of ending claims that he has the best temperament.

* Claims that shooting an Iranian navy ship for taunting US ships wouldn't start a war.

I'm sure there are plenty more but these were the main ones that come to mind. That was an absolute disaster for Trump. He would've been better just not showing up and letting Clinton debate an empty podium."
245,2,"Some more highlights:

* Criticizing Clinton for not being polite enough to President Obama during the 2008 Primary Debates

* Congratulating himself for not being as big of an asshole as he could have been (""I could have said some real nasty stuff about Hillary"")

* Claiming that Clinton has been fighting ISIS ""as long as she's been alive"" and seemingly holding her personally accountable for every single bad thing that has happened in the USA in the last 30 years

* Says that China or Iran should take military action against North Korea

* Says that he - the man running for president of the United States - doesn't think very much about NATO, the military alliance that's one of the cornerstones of our foreign policy

* Imploring Lester Holt and the audience to ""call Sean Hannity"" about his support of the Iraq war, as if what he said privately to a fringe-right talk show host is more important than his public statements in favor of the war"
246,3,The ole Clint Eastwood method lol
247,2,"Ay one point Trump said (I'm paraphrasing) ""I've had great relationships with African Americans over the years"" which to me is another way of saying ""I've got black friends."" Implying he can't be racist. My dad got mad when I pointed that out to him."
248,1,"I know a lot of people are going to complain about Lester being a pushover.  But I honestly think that he didn't have a choice.  If Lester tried to take control he would have been attacked as being pro-hillary and biased against Trump.  Since one of the big takeaways is going to be how Lester lost control of the debate, I think that will allow the moderators to be more direct in the next 2 debates"
249,3,Lester was letting him hang himself. He knew what he was doing.
250,3,"""Not paying federal taxes makes me smart""' your potential next president America.

I can't believe a person running for president could say that and still have a good chance of winning. Wtf?

Edit: A word"
251,3,He literally can't separate his business from his candidacy. It's such a frightening thought.
252,2,"Trump said he has a winning temperament, but interrupting both Hillary and Holt about ten times a minute says otherwise."
253,2,"Lester/Hillary: ""here's a fact""

Trump: *sniff* ""WRONG"""
254,3,That sniffing was pretty annoying.
255,3,"I lost my shit during this, I couldn't keep a straight face "
256,0,The crowd laughing at that was by far my favorite part of the debate.
257,1,The crowd kinda went back and forth with cheers and then Trump got laughed at and really I think that's when the election ended.
258,3,"> that's when the election ended.

or so we hope and pray"
259,3,"Exactly, hes so smart and composed, best temperament.  Yet cant stay on point, does nothing but rambles, interrupts and mocks.  Absolute shit show of a performance and I can't understand how people support someone with such little ideas on policy and what being the President actually means. 


Trump made Mitt Romney look like fucking Obama at this point."
260,2,The laughter from the crowd when he said that tells you all you need to know about that statement.
261,0,[deleted]
262,1,"I knew it would be bad, but I didn't think it would be THAT bad. I honestly thought Clinton would just coast by and let Trump make a fool of himself, but she actually took a pretty successful, humorous, active role. He got clobbered."
263,2,"Prepared for the debate, but also prepared for being president. BAM.

She got stamina. BAM.

After this I found Hillary a lot more likable. This debate also really put a huge spotlight on how much of a horrible president Trump would be."
264,1,This is the most I've listened to Donald Trump and I cannot fathom how anyone could think he's fit for this job. 
265,4,People acting like they're equally horrible must be kidding themselves. This guy is fucking insane.
266,3,"It's because ""they're both equally bad"" requires little thought and makes you sound above the angry masses and smart. It's the new catchphrase."
267,0,[deleted]
268,3,"The funny thing is, it should've been clear months ago. 

"
269,0,[deleted]
270,4,I told a friend before the debate that there wasn't a lesser of the two evils. Now I feel like a fool. 
271,3,"That's what pisses me off about the ""they both suck"" narrative. Yeah, I donated, volunteered, and caucused for Sanders but I'd rather have the candidate who supports 90% of his platform than the candidate who wants to return us to some magical 1950s white wonderland that never existed in the first place."
272,3,He took a shot at her for being prepared. What the fuck is the rationale there?
273,4,"Yes. As a non American, please America, don't make this guy president! You might not like Hilary but I'll take the status quo over that petulant nut job. "
274,3,Jesus I never thought I'd see someone that incoherent given such a high profile stage. What a fucking idiot. Just word salad. He denigrates every American institution and he can't even get out a complete fucking sentence.
275,2,"Hillary: ""Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said, back in 2006, 'Gee I hope it does collapse because then I can go in and buy some, and make some money.' Well it did collapse.""

Trump: ""That's called business, by the way.""

Hillary: ""Nine million people, nine million people lost their jobs, five million people lost their homes, and 13 trillion dollars of family wealth was wiped out.""

One of the worst things that came out of his mouth this debate. "
276,3,"When Hilary was bringing up the fact that he paid zero dollars in federal income tax and Donald responded with ""That's called being smart"" I was floored."
277,2,"Trump ended this thing by complaining that Rosie O'Donnell said bad things about him?  If, god forbid, the man gets elected, that's like the tip of the iceberg."
278,0,"Mfw I hear the phrase ""Rosie O'Donnell"" in a presidential debate"
279,1,"Trump on this debate

""Wrong""

""Lie that's a lie""

""You not very nice""

(Massive Sniffing )


He's the the oldest middle schooler ever
"
280,3,(Sipping water when he's proven wrong)
281,3,"Something, something, Marco Rubio. "
282,3,"Even a middle schooler knows not to interrupt the other person when they are speaking.  If they're respectful, that is."
283,4,"He sounded like a bitter defendant on Judge Judy.

I kinda want her to moderate now..."
284,3,You heard the sniffles too?  I thought he was going to cry.
285,4,"Is it just me, or did Trump sound like a mafia boss, threatening to pull protection from these NATO countries if they don't pay.  ""It would be awful if something happened to your nice little country here."""
286,3,"""Sure would suck if your neighbor got nukes and we weren't defending you."""
287,2,"Living in Europe, we'll take Hillary, if you please. "
288,2,18 of the 20 undecided voters on CNN said Clinton won. 
289,3,"In Orlando Florida, to give context"
290,1,"So, as an outsider I learned in which cities Trump has property and business.

The more you know..."
291,4,"Trump running for president gives me hope that I can still do anything I want in life no matter how bad I am at it.
EDIT: seems like i'm a few million dollars short"
292,3,"Did you inherit millions and millions of dollars and have a rich politically connected parent to bail you out? If not, I've got some bad news for you...."
293,3,All you need is a small loan!
294,1,"""They gave Trump hard questions!"" At this point I feel any question is a hard question for Trump."
295,3,"""will you accept the results of this election"", god what a setup.  Fucking MSM bias amirite???"
296,2,"As a Hillary supporter, I'm surprised there weren't any questions specifically about her private server, so I think there's at least some justification for Trump supporters feeling like he got the tougher questions. That being said, he hasn't done himself any favors over the years by saying so many things that could come back to bite him in the ass."
297,2,There was one but no follow up.  That said trump should have pivoted to that during his ramblings.  
298,2,Hillary admitted she was wrong. Trump doesn't understand how that works so he had no idea how to address it.
299,2,For me Hillary won
300,3,"Was anyone else annoyed by the audience? I thought this was supposed to be strictly enforced silence, and it turned into exchanges of cheers from opposite sides of the room."
301,3,"It was annoying, but to be honest I was surprised it didn't happen more.  Over 90 minutes it wasn't very often."
302,4,"There was a comment a few days ago saying something like ""the whims of a few thousand in an auditorium shouldn't have political sway over 300 million"" and it's absolutely true"
303,4,Really annoying. Audience went out of control just like the debate with all the off-topic talk.
304,1,Trump alienated his own base by making fun of dudes who are 400 pounds.
305,3,And people who pay taxes.  They aren't smart.  
306,3,I keep screaming but God won't answer
307,2,I thought Hillary won that comfortably but then I always think that Trump is bombing when he speaks.
308,1,"Hillary got so much stronger as the debate wore on. With all the talk about stamina, she proved herself here. Trump was Trump."
309,1,It seems that Trump started out restrained but got flustered and fell back into the Trump we all know. I guess what I'm saying is he doesn't have the stamina.
310,3,"The best was when she brought the lawsuits against him for not renting to black people. All he could say was, ""I never admitted guilt"" and that many other companies were being racist too."
311,1,"Am I crazy or did Trump come off as maniacal, overly agressive, and not very knowledgeable? Tough night to watch him.

Edit: was making sure it wasn't confirmation bias. Nope. Trump faceplanted hard."
312,3,When has he not come off as such?
313,1,"Yea, I thought Trump came off as... Trump"
314,3,"""As soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates peace treaties and cease-fires, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.""

I think I heard the ""smack"" that came with that one through my computer."
315,1,"The best part. Donald Trump says he has a great temperament and the audience laughs, thinking he's making a self-deprecating joke.

HE WASN'T!"
316,3,"No, they were laughing at him because they knew he wasn't joking. "
317,2,"I felt Hillary absolutely crushed the section on race. Didn't mince any words, held to her convictions (something I was really happy to see given how rarely I find myself nodding along with her when she speaks) and made a cogent argument all at the same time. Her passion really showed there, and it was something to see.

It surprised me, to be honest. I'm a somewhat reluctant Hillary supporter, thinking she is just the lesser of 2 evils, but that section really, truly convinced me."
318,2,"People don't remember Hillary the radical leftist hippie dippie. Seriously, she was the shit back before she came out the other side of the political machine. I support her mostly based on what her core values seem to be. "
319,2,"Ding ding, that's me. I genuinely don't remember that, I'm probably too young.

My early memories are her against Obama, and I found her lacking up against the passion that he always seemed to show.

His speeches gave me goosebumps, hers made me yawn. This was one of the first times I remember being excited about something she said."
320,3,"Welcome to Actual Clinton. She's spent her entire life in the public sector, and some people are starting to realize *she actually wants to accomplish meaningful things.* There's a reason the Republican Party has done literally everything it can to shut her down."
321,3,"Fair enough, I'm excited to see it."
322,3,I can't believe the whole Global warming issue is still up for debate. It's fucking real and needs to be given priority #1.
323,0,At least it will likely come up in a portion of another debate. This debate didn't have that kind of focus in its topics 
324,1,"[Reminder for the next time a Trump supporter calls you a ""shill"".](http://i.imgur.com/p8tXLys.jpg) "
325,4,"To all the people saying, ""Trump"" didn't talk about Policy, he did. He spent like five minutes agressively advocating for unconstituonal stop and frisk."
326,3,I have property there 😂😭
327,3,They need to give the moderator the ability to cut off the mic of anyone that extends 10 seconds past his warning of time. We just listened to 30 seconds of ranting on the end of every answer.
328,2,"As an Aussie who watched this for laughs, I wouldn't say Hillary won so much as Trump lost to himself

All she had to do was stay reasonably on topic and let him choke on his own words in his follow up"
329,3,"I personally believe that was her entire plan. Plant some seeds to get him riled, then let him loose on something he knows nothing about."
330,3,"When she called him out on being racist, I actually thought she had thrown him into an infinite loop of self-justifying denial."
331,3,I really liked him talking about how proud he was of opening a non-racist club in Palm Beach.
332,1,If this debate shows anything it shows that Hillary has better temperament than Trump does.
333,3,"But he has a winning temperament, the best temperament"
334,2,But trump said so may times that he had the best temperament so how can that be true
335,1,Trump got destroyed with the stamina thing lmao
336,2,Hillary had that comeback ready for years
337,3,That was a beautiful retort
338,3,She crushed him there
339,3,He was trying to dogwhistle that she has no balls but it didn't work out. 
340,3,"He shouldn't have even tried that argument. It only would have worked if she showed any signs of fatigue, and she clearly didn't. "
341,2,The audience laughing at Trump when he said he had a better temperament than Clinton sums up this entire debate in five seconds.
342,1,"It's notable how many times Clinton gave the better answer, and then Trump basically responded with ""oh yeah, I want to do that also""."
343,1,Trump answers were so muddled. He didn't even answer questions.
344,3,I heard 2 concrete policy proposals from Trump (Stop and Frisk and take Iraq's oil) both of which are unconstitutional. One thing we learned: his 10 year old son is good at computers.
345,0,Trump kept sniffing at the beginning of the debate. My friends and I are wondering if he took a bump before the debate to get pumped up.  And the late part of the debate was him getting unraveled.  
346,3,"> Well, I’m really calling for major jobs because the wealthy are going to create tremendous jobs

That should be reason #872 no one votes for him, but alas it probably will make no difference."
347,2,"So did Barack and Hillary found ISIS a few years ago, or has she been fighting them her whole life? I'm confused. "
348,1,"Trump after the debate ""I'm proud of myself that I held back about Bill Clinton's indiscretions"". Wut? Bad move"
349,0,As soon as they mentioned stamina you knew she was going to bring up her 11 hour testimony. That was the moment of the debate. 
350,0,">""Rudolph Giuliani
‏@rudygiulianiGOP
This debate was not @realDonaldTrump's best, but there are still two more. #debatenight""

Lol, stick a fork in this thing. "
351,2,"I am a staunch Bernie supporter, but I have to admit that Hillary is growing on me a little. She went balls to the wall and Trump looked absolutely *awful*. Good god, it was like watching a college debate team dialogue with an angry toddler.

Using adjectives as nouns, repeating himself, losing composure, shouting WRONG as a rebuttal in a formal debate...

Meanwhile Hillary was composed and came out swinging with her policies and a few snappy one-liners to boot. If Trump's numbers don't tank after this, I will permanently lose faith in humanity."
352,4,"I was planning on voting for her, but I didn't really like her up until this point.

Oh my god, I can't believe how well she dealt with him. She kept talking through his interruptions and he couldn't phase her."
353,3,being a mom tends to prepare you for dealing with grumpy toddlers 
354,3,"Whatever she took before the event, I need a lifetime supply of."
355,3,It's her natural STAMINA
356,4,"Finishing words like ""cyber security"" and ""nuclear threat"". Like what the fuck was that? ""The cyber is a real issue."""
357,4,"Agreed, I was a 'I'm voting for Hillary out of fear' guy, but now, I'm starting to like her."
358,2,"Are we the same? I was on the well Hillary isn't trump train but after that, I can't help but smile after some of those one liners."
359,4,"You don't have to like her, but it's hard to admit this debate wasn't enjoyable in its own perverse way."
360,4,"I don't like either of them, but it was satisfying watching Donald act like it was the GOP debate and getting his ass handed to him."
361,2,"I said at the time how crazy the contrasts were.

Bernie and Hillary were deep in the weeds arguing over policy.

Trump and the repubs are calling each other names and comparing dick sizes.

It was insane. I still really don't know how we got here."
362,3,"to me she's kinda running on a ""4 year continuation of obama"" and im okay with the status quo"
363,3,"She's got a lot of sass, and I'm starting to admire it "
364,2,I hate trump so much I'm supporting hillary for the first time since 08
365,3,Thank Christ you guys are finally starting to come around.
366,3,This fucking year.
367,3,"WHY IS NOBODY CALLING SEAN HANNITY!



Donald is asking the questions we all wonder. "
368,1,"So Hillary owned the email server issue as a ""Mistake""

Trump fell back on an openly disproved lie about his tax returns, but ruined the point by admitting he didn't pay federal taxes at all.

How did Trump win this again?"
369,2,That was so insane that the fact Trump said bombing an Iranian ship because they were taunting Americans wouldn't start a war isn't getting mentioned anywhere...I mean.  WTF?!
370,2,"He's already denying everything he said in the debate.

Poor senile bastard."
371,1,"Oh how I wish I could see an Obama vs. Trump debate.

Trump needs the charismatic and intellectual belittling that Obama would give him."
372,1,"If you want to know who won, Here are some gold from the_donald.  ENJOY!:

""I think Trump was weak here. Definitely could have done better.""

""Trump didn't need to win. He just need not to lose.""

""He didn't want to destroy her in the first debate.""


""Guys, this is the first debate. If there's anything we've seen with Trump, it's that he never goes all in at first.""


""I don't think that was a good debate for Don. He was either on the offensive or defensive for entire questions.""


""WHY DIDN'T HE ATTACK HER... I feel so disappointed"""
373,1,"some many broken 12 yr old hearts tonight.

they thought daddy trump was gunna make the bad lady go away"
374,3,I still can't believe he insinuated that he would blackmail other countries for our protection
375,3,So did anybody call Sean Hannity?
376,3,"James Carville: ""He was just ... bad. The further it went the worse it got."""
377,3,"Mostly sounded like ranting from a crazy street person from Donald's side. ""AIRPORTS! CYBER!!! gotta fix cyber. Yeah call Hannity! HE'LL tell ya. Yeah. Hannity knows all about the Kenya thing and the Iraq. YEAH. Hannity 'il tell 'em all."" *sniffles uncontrollably*"
378,2,"Somewhere, a /r/The_Donald poster sighs heavily as he sadly crumples up his hand-made ""Hillary's Cough Count"" poster for the debate.

EDIT: Thank you for the 2x gold, I will be paying it forward with a $~~5~~ $10 donation for Hillary's campaign."
379,4,Sounds like Donald has the sniffles. Weak. And Sad! 
380,3,A common symptom of space cancer
381,3,Indicates bad stamina!
382,1,Trump drank way too much water... he clearly had to piss towards the end of that debate.
383,0,[deleted]
384,1,"Trump brags about winning the online polls.  Guess it's morning in Moscow now, Putin's boys are waking up and trolling internet polls"
385,0,[deleted]
386,3,This I the first time I've seen Trump speak that isn't short segments. Does he always meander incoherently from irrelevant point to irrelevant point without actually saying anything?
387,1,"Assuming Trump doesn't refuse to do the other debates, the moderators *need* to be able to cut the microphones. Trump can't be allowed to ramble on and on like that."
388,4,I'll be very surprised if he does another.  I'm def not a Hill fan but holy shit did he look like a clown tonight and if he has the self awareness to recognize it that's going to sting his pride something awful.
389,4,Trump is like the kid who shows up to class having not done his homework and tries to bullshit on the fly.
390,1,Seeing post debate coverage on msnbc.  Why isn't trump letting Melania speak?
391,1,"Pretty much an unmitigated disaster for Trump. I was wrong, there were low expectations, but he couldn't meet them, wasn't even close. Was incoherent and was challenged on things he usually goes unchallenged on resulting in a lot of incoherent rambling. It's not me either, Giuliani was even saying he had a bad performance. "
392,1,"I honestly don't want to antagonize here, I really just want to know. How do Trump supporters/leaning Trump react when he says things like ""no it wouldn't start a war"" in regard to advocating opening fire on foreign vessels for ""taunting"""
393,2,She said not very nice things about me cried the man who says political correctness is killing this country 
394,3,Are we going to ignore the fact that he advocated for stop and frisk on live TV after he was corrected that it was unconstitutional in NY several times? 
395,3,"Did he just say he takes advantage of the laws of this country for his interests, his company and his family?
He is done. So many sound bites for ads from this debate for the clinton camp to use in ads.
Oh, and also... did he admit he is smart for not paying tax and for cheating small business men?
Congratulations to Hillary Clinton. She did better than I expected."
396,2,"So what I got from Trump: ISIS, *sniffle*, Hillary's website, WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT?, *sniffle*, No, No, *sniffle*, ISIS, other countries are losers who should pay us, I never said that, No, ISIS."
397,1,Fuck. Trump Just told Dana Bash on CNN that he withheld talking about Bills indiscretions and that he might say it next debate. 
398,1,Hillary Clinton spent a few days prepping for the debate. Trump ignored that and just did some rails in the bathroom. The man was high on coke.
399,2,"Trump stammered on in his typical fashion. Hillary was prepared and rehearsed. Compared to his flustered ramblings and dull barbs, she definitely won."
400,3,"Well, that was something. I'm going to have a beer and pretend this didn't happen. "
401,3,Holy shit.... What the hell was that?
402,3,Jesus Christ america you can't be serious with that guy.
403,3,"Wait, so let me get this straight. Admitting to not paying federal income taxes and ""taking advantage of current laws"" makes him smart and a good business man. But American companies exporting jobs to countries with cheaper labor is what then? "
404,1,"He admitted he disrespected Rosie as a woman (called her a pig or a dog right?) and answered to this by claiming she ""deserved it"" adding no one disagrees. 

😳 

Let's add that straw to the camel's back. 

What. A. Shitshow.

Why is this guy a thing? 

Edit: [here](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/10/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-women-viciously-attacked-him-fir/) is a quick run down of his verbal tirades against women. "
405,1,"Did Trump have a cohesive answer for literally any question? Every response was some variation on ""Hillary did X."" Doesn't exactly inspire faith in his plan."
406,1,"The worst part about this is that I have no idea who ""won"" this debate in the eyes of American voters.  
To me Trump seemed like a complete disaster, but that's what I always think whenever he opens his mouth, and yet his campaign is very succesful so far.  

So I just honestly can't tell the difference, what does Trump have to say that would make him lose support?  "
407,3,Bill looks mildly disappointed there aren't any balloons to kick around.
408,1,Trump is clearly not running as a republican. It's the platform he used to get his foot in the door. 
409,3,Someone call Sean Hannity. He's just so lonely.
410,3,braggadocious.
411,1,Trump was going good at first then turned into a train wreck. I honestly couldn't imagine this debate going any better for Hillary.
412,1,Clinton is mean by running ads of Donald Trump speaking.

415,3,"Which is such a weird thing to do in the ""Age of Never Forgetting."" Social media and the rest of the Internet is on the hunt for this shit. And it's real easy when it's on the candidate tweeted it -- in the case of Global Warming -- himself!"
416,1,"It's important to note that she gave a shout-out to S. Korea and Japan and made assurance of their alliance and treaties. 

At that moment, while Trump was defending his ego about delivering Nukes to the Korean Peninsula.. She really gave a needed reality check, and put the purpose of the debate into context. "
417,4,"I think that might be the most important part of the whole debate. No matter who you think won, in that moment, Hillary sounded like a president."
418,1,As expected we learned exactly nothing about Trump's policy. We did learn that he has property in Chicago and Charlotte and on and on. We learned he made 640 million last year. We learned he thinks it's good to profit off economic crisis. We learned he loves to brag about himself more than anything else.
419,1,"Trump produced a number of soundbites that Clinton can use effectively in the days to come.   Mark my words, this is reminiscent of the Kennedy Nixon debates.   Trump being Nixon. "
420,3,"Did Trump argue that we need stop and frisk across America, as in, the Police can stop anyone one of us without cause, and fondle us to search for illegal items for no reason? I'm not about that. "
421,2,"Ooof - Republican analysis on MSNBC:

425,1,If Trump doesn't see a massive drop in the polls after tonight then I don't think he can lose to be honest. 
426,2,"I am a politically uneducated young adult. I have yet to register to vote because I would rather vote *for* a candidate than *against* one, and I have yet to feel any strong connections toward either Hillary or Trump.

After reading/listening to highlights, I believe I would vote for Hillary because she is a politician. That's it. From my point of view, on paper, this should be the simplest election our country will ever see. I know it's not, but come on.

Hypothetically, you and your spouse have planned a date night tomorrow and you need someone to watch your child. Who do you trust more with the life of your offspring in their hands: the high school girl who is posting babysitting flyers around town, or Amanda Bynes? That's what this election feels like to me."
427,3,I hope the USDA was in the building because I just watched a fucking slaughter on TV. 
428,2,"I'm sorry, but if any of you, liberal or conservative, Hillary voter or Trump voter, think Trump did anything close to a good job you are deluded. When the audience grows to laugh after you say ""I have a good temperament"" it's pretty much GG for the night. This is Meek Mill in 2015 levels of taking an L.

Like you could take Hillary out of the equation and his exchanges with Holt are brutal enough by themselves. He was fucking babbling about ""mean attack ads"" to him by the end of it, and his responses to the few fact checks were basically ""Naw bro."""
429,4,Listening to Trump's incoherent ramblings was like listening to the worst modern jazz improvisation ever.
430,2,Hillary took it hands down. Trump looks childish at best and moronic at the worst.
431,3,Was Lester there?
432,3,18 out of 20 undecided voters in cnn focus group say clinton won the debate.  
433,3,"Lol r/the_donald thinks he did bad on purpose to ""bait her"" into the next two debates. "
434,1,"Does anyone find it ironic that Hillary, having the health scare several weeks back looked healthier, more composed, and well tuned than the high energy, anti-establishment Trump? 

Trump got some good digs in, I'll definitely admit. But for every one or two digs Trump got, HRC dug harder. It's funny, Trump's expectations were low and I think he actually was underwhelming. A babbling, incoherent mess.

I think the main take away from this night is that while many feel HRC is untrustworthy, there would much rather take someone who is ready to be POTUS than the quick to anger, unhinged candidate Trump."
435,3,braggadocious
436,1,Trump's lack of intellect is both amusing and troubling.
437,1,"Trump better avoid the media for a while, he's getting scorched all over the place.  "
438,0,"Philly focus group concludes...

Trump: Missed opportunities. Bombastic. Sloppy. Unanswered questions

441,1,"Trump didn't seem well, hope he recovers from his illness soon! "
442,1,I think the biggest concern for the Trump camp here is how easy it's going to be for the Dems to prepare for him in the future. He showed a hell of a lot of weak points here.
443,4,"Everything went Clintons way here... Felt like trump was going to bring the emails up again during the broader discussion of cyber security, but didn't.

Anyone catch that Clinton shimmy dance? Work that into the Shaq cat wiggle gif."
444,3,What in the hell did I just watch...
445,3,shit
446,2,"This debate made me really wish Biden had run. Yes I was a Bernie supporter, and I think Hillary did a fine job, but imagine Trump ranting over Lester and the time limit while Cool Joe just gives the camera a big white smile and a wink. A wink that won the 2016 election. "
447,0,"One thing is for certain, Lester Holt definitely lost this debate. "
448,3,A good moderator really just allows space for the candidates to be themselves
449,4,"I don't know. These guys always get walked over. And Trump is pretty rough to wrangle in a debate. But Lester made it work without cutting anyone's mic. 

Everyone said he'd be a total pushover, and I think he did alright. No one is gonna say he made the debate unfair without looking like a complete fool, and that's important. "
450,1,Here come the Triggered Trump fans
451,1,"Trump blew up in the end talking about Iraq War and Sean Hannity

Cost him the debate"
452,2,"2 things that will get lost in the storm :

1) He said Hillary has been fighting ISIS her entire adult life? 

2) He went ahead and said it's OK to not pay contractors if they ""do a bad job"" "
453,2,"> 1) He said Hillary has been fighting ISIS her entire adult life?

Yeah this shows he has 0 understanding of what ISIS is or how it was formed. "

456,3,"Little early for the postgame thread. 

Saints are only down 10"
457,1,Trump proved today by being uncivil and factually incorrect (adding on the that massive list) that he is a poor fit for president.
458,4,Clinton stayed calm and Trump rambled on and on and looked like a child out there. Clinton won this substantially
459,1,"Did trump answer one question all night? 

What will you do to help middle class Americans? Government is bad and Hillary sucks x7. Next question"
460,1,"""There are so many things we need to be better at, and cyber is one of them."" -Donald J. Trump "
461,1,Trump throwing out threats to Clinton about dropping stuff about her  family. Yeah that's going to work.
462,1,These trump pundits are reaching so hard to show trump won the debate. 
463,1,"One thing that stuck out to me in Trump's rhetoric was that any time he mentioned being worried about a certain place where people were suffering or in trouble, he would throw in that he holds some place of business there, as if that matters one iota. I don't understand what he could gain from mentioning that. "
464,3,"Oh guys did you hear that? Its not nice! Its not nice that ""Crooked Hilary"" has done this!"
465,1,"trump started fine, then went back to his crazy self of repeating the same shit over and over. Clinton was her boring self as always which i dont think is bad"
466,1,"paraphrasing here but:

Clinton: ""Trump has not released his tax returns because it probably shows that he's paid nothing in federal income tax""

Trump interrupting: ""that makes me very smart""

Clinton: ""Which means he's paid ZERO to support our troops, help our veterans, and help educate our children""

Trump made so many flubs and mistakes in the debate. It was pretty hard to keep count. But the biggest one in my opinion was how he buckled down on wanting to blow up an Iranian sailing vessel for taunting us.

TO SHOOT AT ANOTHER VESSEL IS AN ACT OF WAR. That will definitely start a war. And a war with a power that, if they don't currently have nuclear weapons, was at least 2 steps away from having them. 

And we started a [war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish%E2%80%93American_War#USS_Maine) over similar actions. [Twice.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_incident#Consequences)

I also like how he apparently has not commented on Russia doing [similar actions to our naval vessels](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/18/politics/russia-jets-buzz-u-s-ship-rules-of-engagement/) in open waters. And [our airplanes.](http://www.businessinsider.com/ap-navy-boss-russian-jets-should-stop-buzzing-us-planes-ship-2016-5) 

But no, lets start yet another war because of bruised egos. It isn't like [we grandstand all the damn time.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_evil)"
474,1,nato isnt paying their fair share.  neither is donald.  clinton needs to keep hitting him on that  
475,2,Easily a loss for Trump there. He actually said he mightn't have paid his workers because they didn't do a good job... So many easy soundbites for the Clinton campaign on this one. 
476,2,"Oh my God. On C-SPANthey showed a tweet that said ""You're fucking retarded."" uncensored.  Hahahahahah"

Our **post debate poll finds voters think Hillary Clinton won 51-40**. Full results coming in next half hour"
481,1,Anyone see that trump tantrum on MSNBC?
482,1,"Trump saying his winning asset being his temperment is like the Oakland Raiders saying their winning asset is their penalty yardage. Regardless of how you feel about Trump, I have a hard time believing anyone would honestly agree with him on that particular sentiment"
483,1,"""When they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should of included, the fact that, they do something with respect to North Korea. They should of done something with respect to Yemen, and all these other places"" - I think Trump has finally revealed his secret foreign policy plan, get Iran to do everything."
484,2,"Hillary won for sure.
Still can't stand her though.
God I'm gonna have to hold my nose this time around aren't I?"
485,3,Hilary spent her entire adult life fighting Isis. Now that's  stamina.
486,1,Trump definitely lost this debate. 
487,3,"He kept slipping until he finally torpedoed himself by going after Lester then capping it with ""I have the best temperament""."
488,1,"This really made me think Trump doesn't know what he is doing. Trump has been focus grouped widely and he is constantly referred to as unstable and impulsive. This is a flaw of his that some voters dont mind because they prefer his out of the box thinking and genuine style. Those are his strengths and weaknesses.


When he says ""I have the best temperament"" he just says something that voters know isn't true. He is talking as if he doesn't know or didn't study what voters think if him."
489,3,Clinton was savage tonight. She let him dig his own hole. And boy did he keep digging
490,3,After his longest rant I swear she sighed a sigh of relief.
491,3,That hole just got 10ft deeper. 
492,3,"The fact check was his worst nightmare, it seems"
493,1,"Yeah, he was pretty weak throughout. Hell, even if you were a Trump supporter I don't see how you could think he was strong in this."
494,3,Because facts don't matter.
495,3,I trust they'll find a way on /r/The_Donald.
496,3,He was on defense nearly the ENTIRE TIME.  Absolutely brutal.
497,3,He got demolished. The birth certificate discussion was a disaster.
498,2,"He wasn't even apologetic, he was glad to tell us all about how he was the one to get Obama to release his birth certificate and that blacks and Obama should be thanking him.  When he said that he helped the black community by forcing Obama to release his birth certificate my jaw was on the floor.  "
499,3,"and then claimed it's good business

i'm amazed he has any support since most of his support is poor and middle class white men, the exact people who get screwed when the rich don't pay taxes"
500,3,"It's because he's smart.  And wanting the real estate market to dive in 2006 was just good business.

Oh, and 'Bigly.'"
501,3,There goes that Reddit vote.
502,3,"Considering how popular Fat People Hate was, there's at least a portion who's sticking around."
503,3,That's the voat vote. 
504,2,Chris Christie. As it was said on CBCNN.
505,2,"That whole tangent about how he built a resort in Palm Beach or whatever so he can't be racist made so little sense it made my head spin. He just tries to shoe horn in bullshit to make him seem successful at every possible opportunity. And then he said Palm Beach was the wealthiest place in the world, which is not even close, it's not even in the top 100 wealthiest places in the US. Trump loves to exaggerate his wealth and apparently everybody else's too. I don't believe for a second he's actually a billionaire. "
506,3,"A guy who cheated on his first wife, married his mistress, then divorced her, and is currently on wife #3. He really is stunning in his lack of self awareness. "
507,2,"So far in this election cycle, Trump has been caught redhanded doing the exact things he's been accusing Hillary of doing. Hes the king of projection. Makes me think he is having some serious health issues himself."
508,4,My favorite was when he basically told Hilary that she wasn't nice. Like... has he heard anything he's said in the past year?
509,3,Well keep in mind he's also very proud that he started an establishment in Palm Beach that allowed black people.
510,2,"Hillary would've responded ""says the man on his third wife"""
511,3,"""... who had infamously cheated on his first wife.""

IIRC, he cheated on his second wife too but it was certainly big news when he cheated on his first because he married the woman he had the affair with (a young model) shortly after divorcing his wife who was a celebrity herself."
512,3,How can he possibly think bringing up that is a GOOD tactic??! 
513,2,"ya that comment was gross.  said he had some bad things to say about bill clinton, and that hes proud he held back, but maybe youll see at the 2nd debate.  dude is trailer park trash."
514,4,They need to cut mics. Enforce time limits and treat them like children if they need to.
515,3,YES. Why did they not cut off the microphones during their 2 minute speeches? The media didn't want the debate; they wanted the entertainment.
516,3,The candidates would never agree to it.
517,2,"""Please only 20 seconds"" is the funniest thing that was said all night"
518,3,I had to just break out in laughter at that point. Question is about black inequality and says he supports stop and frisk.  Forget about if he's right or not that it will help black communities. Just the fact that he actually thought he would be able to **gain black support** by endorsing **stop and frisk** of all things shows the immeasurable disconnect he has with the black community.
519,2,"When he said this in response to bridging the racial devide I was stunned, actually stunned. Voices went all charlie browns parents for a moment as I let that moment sink in... it's one of the most out of touch responses I've seen... It almost has comedic timing with how confidently it defies comprehension."
520,3,"I didn't think he could do anything to give Clinton more of the black vote, but Stop and Frisk was struck down as Unconstitutional for a reason. He's just so out of touch...."
521,3,My understanding is that he is out of touch on all levels. He should have stayed in the shadows and continued to pay politicians to do his bidding. He would have had auch better shot at having influence and power in government. 
522,3,He's not trying to gain the black vote; it's more dog whistling to his white base.
523,3,"Well he's built very, very good relationships with them over............the last little while. "
524,3,"Yeah, the people in the Harlem bar where I was watching--you know, the ones actually subjected to it--applauded that part. They also loved hearing that they couldn't walk in their own neighborhood without getting shot. (/s for anyone who needs it)"
525,2,"Even funnier, I think he just said ""cyber"", without the security part, similar to what he did with ""nuclear"" later on."
526,3,Well what do you expect? Cyber is a very bigly problem.  /s
527,3,Security is the most important part of Cyber.
528,3,Lol that bit with his son went nowhere

530,3,A lot of people have told him how well he did. 
531,3,*Very smart* people
532,3,And they told him! 
533,2,"And they said, they said to him:"

535,3,Which polls?
536,3,all of them
537,3,Says who?
538,2,I just said. All of them.
539,3,"ok, and your question is?"

I bet he would nuke the whole Middle East if a single government official in Pakistan said something bad about him (yes, I know Pakistan isn't in the Middle East, but Trump sure as shit doesn't)"
562,0,I think that line is going to be replayed ad nauseam for the next couple of days until the next debate
563,3,"I think the profiting from he housing crisis as being ""good business"" or ""smart business"" or whatever he said is going to be the takeaway

Edit: http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-on-rooting-for-housing-crisis-thats-called-business-2016-09-26 -- that's what I'm talking about"
564,3,"or the fucking comment on the first strike

or how he had nothing to say on race relations but ""we need law and order"" and his promotion of stop and frisk"
565,3,"He basically admitted to not paying taxes, not paying staff and contractors, etc. What a mess. "
566,0,"Not only that, he compounded it when later in the debate he talked about nations in NATO  not paying their fair share, under treaty, under contract. Does he realize the contradiction?"
567,1,"If cornered, his campaign (probably Conway, I don't know if Trump will actually answer) will respond by saying that it's showing that they're smart to take advantage of us. 

We've been ""dumb"" so far by letting them do so. 

(Not my views, just how I anticipate them responding)"
568,2,The weird part was when he said he was gonna say something really disrespectful toward Hillary and her family but decided not to cause he realized it was mean. 
569,3,"What a good kind hearted person. He would blow up Iran, stop and frisk people, but he wouldn't dare insult Hillary with whatever it was. What a man."

585,3,"Oh, we of other countries don't look at this election so scornfully or mockingly, but rather in shock and disbelief. Either the majority of the US voters has lost  their rootin tootin minds or the US has ceased being a functional democracy. Both scenarios are grim :/"

587,3,"I'd recommend watching either the '08 or '12 debates, then weep at what democracy has lost."
588,0,"I like the combo of debate 1 and 2 of '12. It shows Obama getting beat pretty handedly but still staying composed. Then regrouping and  having a great showing in the second debate. 

Trump was crushed in this debate but somehow I doubt he will learn from it, work hard to prepare for the next one, and come out ready to battle."
589,1,"I think there is a very good discussion to be had over the role of the government.

But that is not what we received here tonight from Trump. Other elections are much much better."
590,4,It's so fucking crazy. I honestly though Mitt sounded like a crazy robot during his debates and cringed at half of his stuff (binders full of women). But now...now Romney seems like serious candidate. 
591,1,"Romney was rich and somewhat disconnected, but he was largely a normal person with proper manners. Trump doesn't have any manners at all. No sense of what constitutes polite discourse. "
592,3,"No, no, you misunderstand. That's just for *inner city folk*. You know... *Urban people*. \*wink*"
593,3,I don't even know what he was trying to say with that. It was a total non-sequitur. 
594,3,"I still liked, ""I can deal with cybersecurity because, look i have a 10 year old son, he's great with computers, you wouldn't even believe.""
 
Ok......"
595,3,"Imagine the confusion of being that kid right now. 

""What does he mean? Am I in charge of cyber intelligence now? Wtf dad?"""
596,3,This kid can make a minecraft house in ten minutes. Obviously the best at what he does
597,3,Nerd!!!! I mean do we really want someone who is smart and does their own research about the issues? I want someone I can drink a beer with God dammit!!!!!
598,4,"Just like basically every criticism of Hillary. If there's something good to say about her, then its really bad somehow."
599,4,It's almost like it's important to prepare for a debate in front of millions. 
600,3,"They're getting overtime for sure, no ones sleeping tonight. "
601,1,"Trump tonight:

http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/sometimes-i-start-a-sentence.jpg"
602,3,"Didn't he say something about ""No it won't"" when Hilary mention that it would start a war by bombing the sailors?

I hope I didn't hear it wrong, beacuse I laughed so much xD"
603,3,"Yes. Yes he did. As if major conflicts, world wars even, were never started as the result of one nations firing on another's warships or transports.

Edit: words n' stuff"
604,3,Oh yeah!  Absolutely fucking unreal.  
605,1,"Remember the gulf of Tonkin incident?

Trump doesn't. "
606,3,"Listen, trust me. We have to assisnate Franz Ferdinand. It totally won't start a war. Trust me."
607,3,"Come now.  When has attacking a boat ever started a war lol


(You know, other than America in WW1, Spanish American war, Pearl Harbor, War of 1812, and Vietnam). "
608,3,"""That wouldn't start a war"" WTF attacking another country would clearly start a war. "
609,4,"Oh please.   The United States of America has only gone to war like, three, *maybe* four times tops, due to a civilian ship being destroyed by a foreign government. 

(It's something like that right? I'm a Canadian but there was that Spanish war ship, the Lusitania for WWI, was Gulf of Tonkin a civilian ship?, and I feel like I'm missing some big one somewhere)."
610,3,When Mr Bigly told the moderator that Stop and Frisk wasn't ruled unconsitutional I laughed for a minute and then sighed deeply.
611,4,He was told it was unconstitutional... then KEPT ON using it as his main policy proposal. That was like Marco Rubio levels of rote memorization with no thinking on his feet.
612,3,"Not to mention him trying to deny that the murder rate in NYC continued to decline past 500/yr. It literally took me 30 seconds to look that up and prove he was lying: http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_statistics/cs-en-us-city.pdf

I'm honestly trying to be open to his ideas but he just keeps spewing so much bullshit it's hard to take anything he says seriously."
613,3,As a response to a question about race relations.  
614,1,my mom is a hardcore trump supporter but acknowledged his performance as terrible before turning it off early. lol
615,2,"I think people like a winner. If the narrative in the media is that Trump lost, people who don't follow politics closely will begin to see Hillary as the inevitable winner and next president. Debates are never about specifics on the macro level. They are about momentum, and right now Hillary has it all. "
616,3,"What about the violence in Charlotte?

I own property there, too."
617,2,"Yes it was.  He also said he didn't pay any federal tax ""because I'm smart"".
"
618,2,Before this he even said he was smart for avoiding paying taxes.
619,3,"""Not nice!""

At least he'll get the toddler vote"
620,3,I think Trump was more of his own worse enemy. Getting into the birther thing and the Rosie thing he should of just moved on instead of going into those.
621,3,"He can't help himself, he's so fucking petty - temperamentally unfit for office. "
622,3,"That's not true, he has the best temperament. A winning temperament. "
623,4,Didn't he say something like we all agree Rosie deserved it? 
624,3,She should have pointed out how making corporations stay in the country is technically a regulation.
625,1,"The smartest decision was not even saying anything about Trump's Sanders comment. 

"
626,2,"He went from calling her Secy. Clinton to just Hillary.  She definitely got under his skin, but then agsin, it's so very thin, it was expected. "
627,3,Usually they are asked to stay silent so they are a non-factor.  I think its mostly for show 
628,3,They were asked to stay silent. They just didn't.
629,4,"I loved how sarcastic Hillary got. It was fantastic. I wanted ice queen Clinton to show up to the debate, but I think I actually like aloof, no-fucks-given, sarcastic Clinton more."
630,3,"Her ""it's a good line"" was fucking fantastic. "
631,3,"he denied his comments on global warming, on women and black people, on the Iraq war, on Libya, and all of those are so easily verified

the only people who think he won or got anything other than annihilated are idiots on /r/the_donald who refuse to fact check "
632,3,Wrong /s
633,4,"He won the debate for her. When the moderator says you made a comment, you better be pretty sure before you challenge it. Chances are you'll look like an idiot."
634,3,Especially when you start arguing with a black man about the racist policies that were Stop and Frisk.  
635,3,"I was only listening to it on NPR, didn't know he was black. That makes it much more interesting."
636,1,"Yea, Lester Holt, the moderator, is a black man.  And he's a registered republican.  So it was especially fascinating when Trump accused him last week of being a democrat.  But then even more fascinating was that his campaign defended this error by saying that Trump didn't know that Holt was a republican, which of course begs the question as to how did Trump assume that Holt was a democrat? Because he's black? "
637,3,because his supporters are goldfish with no memory or motivation to look it up and just believe him when he says he didn't say those things 
638,3,"This is patently false. Goldfish have perfectly average memory capabilities, and can even differentiate their owners/caretakers from other humans."
639,3,"My apologies to goldfish, lets say I was referring to the healthy cracker snack"
640,2,"Hillary saying that yes, she did prepare for the debate, ""and I also prepared to become President of the United States"" was savage."
641,3,That was the knock-out punch.  Everything after that was him trying to get back up. 
642,3,One liner of the whole night for sure
643,4,I think it's more like the teacher vs a kid whose cheat notes written on his hand got smudged.
644,3,"""I have nothing better to offer you"" was pretty loud and clear."
645,3,"If there's one thing black people love most, it's being unconstitutionally stopped and searched by police officers simply because of their skin color.

They're also on board with Iran invading North Korea, I heard."
646,3,"On top of that, he's also touting the biggest tax cut in history.  So, how exactly will we be fixing that infrastructure?

"
647,0,[deleted]
648,3,"Don't forget that he responded an accusation of taking advantage of the 2008 crisis to rip off people with ""it's business"". So not only is he proud of cheating taxes, he's also proud of making his money at the expense of others. "
649,0,[deleted]
650,2,This is the statement that will define why Hillary wins in November.
651,3,Nothing will lose him their vote.
652,3,"""hey guys he gave us a shout out"""
653,0,[You're not even kidding](http://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/54ol3s/postdebate_magathread_another_win_for_trump_are/d83mt26)
654,3,Because they're not old enough to vote.
655,3,Cheetos were spilled.  
656,2,I absolutely lost my shit when he said that.
657,4,That's also like half of /pol/
658,3,I just did a Peter Lorre laugh
659,4,">Donald was rude, disrespectful, and at times full of total BS. 

Kind of like how he's been for his entire campaign."
660,3,His birther arguments were complete gibberish. No idea what he was saying. 
661,2,omfg that last question where he started ranting about maga and then just said that he'd support her lmao
662,3,"You could just tell how happy she was to have a chance to say that. Someone else guessed that every time she smiled while donald talked, she had already prepared a counterpoint, and I think they were right."
663,3,"Can you even imagine being her and hearing such horrible sexist shit about why you're unfit to be president? You don't look the part, you're mentally incompetent, etc... Glad she was able to respond to that garbagw"
664,4,she spent his time talking either smiling or looking like [this](http://67.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mb8x9iiu8q1rbzx9io2_1280.jpg)
665,0,For real. Dude can't even do a 90 minute debate
666,3,The cocaine was wearing off towards the end and he was just getting cranky. 
667,3,"It's clearly Adderall, but yeah."
668,3,He's a creature of the 80s. I don't really think he was on coke but it wouldn't surprise me if he was because he felt he needed that old reliable boost. 
669,3,"He petered out about halfway through. It was quite amusing, you could see him get tired and frustrated."
670,3,"She did drop some sick burns tonight, not gonna lie. I don't support either of them, but man that was just wow."
671,3,that and the tweet quote were strong ones
672,4,"She definitely used her best zingers, like a greatest hits. That one, and ""the only secret is he has no plan.""  Hopefully her team comes up with new ones for the next debate. I agree with Trump that it's getting old almost as much as I agree with Hillary that it's a good one."
673,1,"Clinton basically apologising the world for Trump was actually funny, but him saying America shouldn't be a world police is also smart, but then he rambled forever"
674,3,Hopefully undecideds watched the whole thing 
675,3,We did! We're decided now.
676,3,I did. And now I'm not.
677,0,"[deleted]  
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.6338 
 > [What is this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/57407)"
678,2,"Yeah, the opening handshake was good.  Then he greeted Hillary, and it was all downhill from there."
679,2,"Condescendingly asking if he could call her Secretary Clinton, and then using the word secretary in a seemingly pejorative sense throughout the debate made me angry. But Hillary's constant calm, earnest and cool attitude settled me down."
680,2,"Some more highlights:

* Criticizing Clinton for not being polite enough to President Obama during the 2008 Primary Debates

* Congratulating himself for not being as big of an asshole as he could have been (""I could have said some real nasty stuff about Hillary"")

* Claiming that Clinton has been fighting ISIS ""as long as she's been alive"" and seemingly holding her personally accountable for every single bad thing that has happened in the USA in the last 30 years

* Says that China or Iran should take military action against North Korea

* Says that he - the man running for president of the United States - doesn't think very much about NATO, the military alliance that's one of the cornerstones of our foreign policy

* Imploring Lester Holt and the audience to ""call Sean Hannity"" about his support of the Iraq war, as if what he said privately to a fringe-right talk show host is more important than his public statements in favor of the war"
681,3,The ole Clint Eastwood method lol
682,2,"Ay one point Trump said (I'm paraphrasing) ""I've had great relationships with African Americans over the years"" which to me is another way of saying ""I've got black friends."" Implying he can't be racist. My dad got mad when I pointed that out to him."
683,3,Lester was letting him hang himself. He knew what he was doing.
684,3,He literally can't separate his business from his candidacy. It's such a frightening thought.
685,2,"Lester/Hillary: ""here's a fact""

Trump: *sniff* ""WRONG"""
686,3,That sniffing was pretty annoying.
687,3,"I lost my shit during this, I couldn't keep a straight face "
688,0,The crowd laughing at that was by far my favorite part of the debate.
689,1,The crowd kinda went back and forth with cheers and then Trump got laughed at and really I think that's when the election ended.
690,3,"> that's when the election ended.

or so we hope and pray"
691,3,"Exactly, hes so smart and composed, best temperament.  Yet cant stay on point, does nothing but rambles, interrupts and mocks.  Absolute shit show of a performance and I can't understand how people support someone with such little ideas on policy and what being the President actually means. 


Trump made Mitt Romney look like fucking Obama at this point."
692,2,The laughter from the crowd when he said that tells you all you need to know about that statement.
693,0,[deleted]
694,2,"Prepared for the debate, but also prepared for being president. BAM.

She got stamina. BAM.

After this I found Hillary a lot more likable. This debate also really put a huge spotlight on how much of a horrible president Trump would be."
695,3,"It's because ""they're both equally bad"" requires little thought and makes you sound above the angry masses and smart. It's the new catchphrase."
696,0,[deleted]
697,3,"The funny thing is, it should've been clear months ago. 

"
698,0,[deleted]
699,4,I told a friend before the debate that there wasn't a lesser of the two evils. Now I feel like a fool. 
700,3,"That's what pisses me off about the ""they both suck"" narrative. Yeah, I donated, volunteered, and caucused for Sanders but I'd rather have the candidate who supports 90% of his platform than the candidate who wants to return us to some magical 1950s white wonderland that never existed in the first place."
701,3,He took a shot at her for being prepared. What the fuck is the rationale there?
702,4,"Yes. As a non American, please America, don't make this guy president! You might not like Hilary but I'll take the status quo over that petulant nut job. "
703,3,"When Hilary was bringing up the fact that he paid zero dollars in federal income tax and Donald responded with ""That's called being smart"" I was floored."
704,0,"Mfw I hear the phrase ""Rosie O'Donnell"" in a presidential debate"
705,3,(Sipping water when he's proven wrong)
706,3,"Something, something, Marco Rubio. "
707,3,"Even a middle schooler knows not to interrupt the other person when they are speaking.  If they're respectful, that is."
708,4,"He sounded like a bitter defendant on Judge Judy.

I kinda want her to moderate now..."
709,3,You heard the sniffles too?  I thought he was going to cry.
710,3,"""Sure would suck if your neighbor got nukes and we weren't defending you."""
711,2,"Living in Europe, we'll take Hillary, if you please. "
712,3,"In Orlando Florida, to give context"
713,3,"Did you inherit millions and millions of dollars and have a rich politically connected parent to bail you out? If not, I've got some bad news for you...."
714,3,All you need is a small loan!
715,3,"""will you accept the results of this election"", god what a setup.  Fucking MSM bias amirite???"
716,2,"As a Hillary supporter, I'm surprised there weren't any questions specifically about her private server, so I think there's at least some justification for Trump supporters feeling like he got the tougher questions. That being said, he hasn't done himself any favors over the years by saying so many things that could come back to bite him in the ass."
717,2,There was one but no follow up.  That said trump should have pivoted to that during his ramblings.  
718,2,Hillary admitted she was wrong. Trump doesn't understand how that works so he had no idea how to address it.
719,3,"It was annoying, but to be honest I was surprised it didn't happen more.  Over 90 minutes it wasn't very often."
720,4,"There was a comment a few days ago saying something like ""the whims of a few thousand in an auditorium shouldn't have political sway over 300 million"" and it's absolutely true"
721,4,Really annoying. Audience went out of control just like the debate with all the off-topic talk.
722,3,And people who pay taxes.  They aren't smart.  
723,1,"Hillary got so much stronger as the debate wore on. With all the talk about stamina, she proved herself here. Trump was Trump."
724,1,It seems that Trump started out restrained but got flustered and fell back into the Trump we all know. I guess what I'm saying is he doesn't have the stamina.
725,3,"The best was when she brought the lawsuits against him for not renting to black people. All he could say was, ""I never admitted guilt"" and that many other companies were being racist too."
726,3,When has he not come off as such?
727,1,"Yea, I thought Trump came off as... Trump"
728,3,"No, they were laughing at him because they knew he wasn't joking. "
729,2,"People don't remember Hillary the radical leftist hippie dippie. Seriously, she was the shit back before she came out the other side of the political machine. I support her mostly based on what her core values seem to be. "
730,2,"Ding ding, that's me. I genuinely don't remember that, I'm probably too young.

My early memories are her against Obama, and I found her lacking up against the passion that he always seemed to show.

His speeches gave me goosebumps, hers made me yawn. This was one of the first times I remember being excited about something she said."
731,3,"Welcome to Actual Clinton. She's spent her entire life in the public sector, and some people are starting to realize *she actually wants to accomplish meaningful things.* There's a reason the Republican Party has done literally everything it can to shut her down."
732,3,"Fair enough, I'm excited to see it."
733,0,At least it will likely come up in a portion of another debate. This debate didn't have that kind of focus in its topics 
734,3,"I personally believe that was her entire plan. Plant some seeds to get him riled, then let him loose on something he knows nothing about."
735,3,"When she called him out on being racist, I actually thought she had thrown him into an infinite loop of self-justifying denial."
736,3,I really liked him talking about how proud he was of opening a non-racist club in Palm Beach.
737,3,"But he has a winning temperament, the best temperament"
738,2,But trump said so may times that he had the best temperament so how can that be true
739,2,Hillary had that comeback ready for years
740,3,That was a beautiful retort
741,3,She crushed him there
742,3,He was trying to dogwhistle that she has no balls but it didn't work out. 
743,3,"He shouldn't have even tried that argument. It only would have worked if she showed any signs of fatigue, and she clearly didn't. "
744,4,"I was planning on voting for her, but I didn't really like her up until this point.

Oh my god, I can't believe how well she dealt with him. She kept talking through his interruptions and he couldn't phase her."
745,3,being a mom tends to prepare you for dealing with grumpy toddlers 
746,3,"Whatever she took before the event, I need a lifetime supply of."
747,3,It's her natural STAMINA
748,4,"Finishing words like ""cyber security"" and ""nuclear threat"". Like what the fuck was that? ""The cyber is a real issue."""
749,4,"Agreed, I was a 'I'm voting for Hillary out of fear' guy, but now, I'm starting to like her."
750,2,"Are we the same? I was on the well Hillary isn't trump train but after that, I can't help but smile after some of those one liners."
751,4,"You don't have to like her, but it's hard to admit this debate wasn't enjoyable in its own perverse way."
752,4,"I don't like either of them, but it was satisfying watching Donald act like it was the GOP debate and getting his ass handed to him."
753,2,"I said at the time how crazy the contrasts were.

Bernie and Hillary were deep in the weeds arguing over policy.

Trump and the repubs are calling each other names and comparing dick sizes.

It was insane. I still really don't know how we got here."
754,3,"to me she's kinda running on a ""4 year continuation of obama"" and im okay with the status quo"
755,3,"She's got a lot of sass, and I'm starting to admire it "
756,2,I hate trump so much I'm supporting hillary for the first time since 08
757,3,Thank Christ you guys are finally starting to come around.
758,1,"some many broken 12 yr old hearts tonight.

they thought daddy trump was gunna make the bad lady go away"
759,4,Sounds like Donald has the sniffles. Weak. And Sad! 
760,3,A common symptom of space cancer
761,3,Indicates bad stamina!
762,1,Trump drank way too much water... he clearly had to piss towards the end of that debate.
763,4,I'll be very surprised if he does another.  I'm def not a Hill fan but holy shit did he look like a clown tonight and if he has the self awareness to recognize it that's going to sting his pride something awful.
764,3,"Which is such a weird thing to do in the ""Age of Never Forgetting."" Social media and the rest of the Internet is on the hunt for this shit. And it's real easy when it's on the candidate tweeted it -- in the case of Global Warming -- himself!"
765,4,"I think that might be the most important part of the whole debate. No matter who you think won, in that moment, Hillary sounded like a president."
766,3,A good moderator really just allows space for the candidates to be themselves
767,4,"I don't know. These guys always get walked over. And Trump is pretty rough to wrangle in a debate. But Lester made it work without cutting anyone's mic. 

Everyone said he'd be a total pushover, and I think he did alright. No one is gonna say he made the debate unfair without looking like a complete fool, and that's important. "
768,2,"> 1) He said Hillary has been fighting ISIS her entire adult life?

Yeah this shows he has 0 understanding of what ISIS is or how it was formed. "
769,3,3) He thinks opening a business that doesn't discriminate is an achievement.
770,3,"He kept slipping until he finally torpedoed himself by going after Lester then capping it with ""I have the best temperament""."
771,1,"This really made me think Trump doesn't know what he is doing. Trump has been focus grouped widely and he is constantly referred to as unstable and impulsive. This is a flaw of his that some voters dont mind because they prefer his out of the box thinking and genuine style. Those are his strengths and weaknesses.


When he says ""I have the best temperament"" he just says something that voters know isn't true. He is talking as if he doesn't know or didn't study what voters think if him."
772,3,Clinton was savage tonight. She let him dig his own hole. And boy did he keep digging
773,3,After his longest rant I swear she sighed a sigh of relief.
774,3,That hole just got 10ft deeper. 
775,3,"The fact check was his worst nightmare, it seems"
776,1,"Yeah, he was pretty weak throughout. Hell, even if you were a Trump supporter I don't see how you could think he was strong in this."
777,3,Because facts don't matter.
778,3,I trust they'll find a way on /r/The_Donald.
779,3,He was on defense nearly the ENTIRE TIME.  Absolutely brutal.
780,3,He got demolished. The birth certificate discussion was a disaster.
781,2,"He wasn't even apologetic, he was glad to tell us all about how he was the one to get Obama to release his birth certificate and that blacks and Obama should be thanking him.  When he said that he helped the black community by forcing Obama to release his birth certificate my jaw was on the floor.  "
782,3,"Considering how popular Fat People Hate was, there's at least a portion who's sticking around."
783,3,That's the voat vote. 
784,2,"So far in this election cycle, Trump has been caught redhanded doing the exact things he's been accusing Hillary of doing. Hes the king of projection. Makes me think he is having some serious health issues himself."
785,4,My favorite was when he basically told Hilary that she wasn't nice. Like... has he heard anything he's said in the past year?
786,3,"""... who had infamously cheated on his first wife.""

IIRC, he cheated on his second wife too but it was certainly big news when he cheated on his first because he married the woman he had the affair with (a young model) shortly after divorcing his wife who was a celebrity herself."
787,3,YES. Why did they not cut off the microphones during their 2 minute speeches? The media didn't want the debate; they wanted the entertainment.
788,3,The candidates would never agree to it.
789,2,"When he said this in response to bridging the racial devide I was stunned, actually stunned. Voices went all charlie browns parents for a moment as I let that moment sink in... it's one of the most out of touch responses I've seen... It almost has comedic timing with how confidently it defies comprehension."
790,3,"I didn't think he could do anything to give Clinton more of the black vote, but Stop and Frisk was struck down as Unconstitutional for a reason. He's just so out of touch...."
791,3,My understanding is that he is out of touch on all levels. He should have stayed in the shadows and continued to pay politicians to do his bidding. He would have had auch better shot at having influence and power in government. 
792,3,He's not trying to gain the black vote; it's more dog whistling to his white base.
793,3,Well what do you expect? Cyber is a very bigly problem.  /s
794,3,Security is the most important part of Cyber.
795,3,*Very smart* people
796,3,And they told him! 
797,2,"And they said, they said to him:"
798,3,"You did a great, a really tremendous job. Believe me, folks!"
799,3,all of them
800,3,Says who?
801,2,I just said. All of them.
802,3,"ok, and your question is?"
803,3,"If it ain't Breitbart ^^^or ^^^Stormfront, it's the biased MSM!"
804,3,"I dunno, one time the Seahawks passed when they should have run."

Truly prophetic. "
826,3,Cartman is also smarter. 
827,3,Respect my authoritehh!!
828,1,*Trump's temperament 
829,3,"Oh, we of other countries don't look at this election so scornfully or mockingly, but rather in shock and disbelief. Either the majority of the US voters has lost  their rootin tootin minds or the US has ceased being a functional democracy. Both scenarios are grim :/"
830,3,"I'd recommend watching either the '08 or '12 debates, then weep at what democracy has lost."
831,0,"I like the combo of debate 1 and 2 of '12. It shows Obama getting beat pretty handedly but still staying composed. Then regrouping and  having a great showing in the second debate. 

Trump was crushed in this debate but somehow I doubt he will learn from it, work hard to prepare for the next one, and come out ready to battle."
832,1,"I think there is a very good discussion to be had over the role of the government.

But that is not what we received here tonight from Trump. Other elections are much much better."
833,1,"Romney was rich and somewhat disconnected, but he was largely a normal person with proper manners. Trump doesn't have any manners at all. No sense of what constitutes polite discourse. "
834,3,"I still liked, ""I can deal with cybersecurity because, look i have a 10 year old son, he's great with computers, you wouldn't even believe.""
 
Ok......"
835,3,"Imagine the confusion of being that kid right now. 

""What does he mean? Am I in charge of cyber intelligence now? Wtf dad?"""
836,3,This kid can make a minecraft house in ten minutes. Obviously the best at what he does
837,3,"Yes. Yes he did. As if major conflicts, world wars even, were never started as the result of one nations firing on another's warships or transports.

Edit: words n' stuff"
838,3,Oh yeah!  Absolutely fucking unreal.  
839,1,"Remember the gulf of Tonkin incident?

Trump doesn't. "
840,3,"Listen, trust me. We have to assisnate Franz Ferdinand. It totally won't start a war. Trust me."
841,3,"Come now.  When has attacking a boat ever started a war lol


(You know, other than America in WW1, Spanish American war, Pearl Harbor, War of 1812, and Vietnam). "
842,4,"Oh please.   The United States of America has only gone to war like, three, *maybe* four times tops, due to a civilian ship being destroyed by a foreign government. 

(It's something like that right? I'm a Canadian but there was that Spanish war ship, the Lusitania for WWI, was Gulf of Tonkin a civilian ship?, and I feel like I'm missing some big one somewhere)."
843,4,He was told it was unconstitutional... then KEPT ON using it as his main policy proposal. That was like Marco Rubio levels of rote memorization with no thinking on his feet.
844,3,"Not to mention him trying to deny that the murder rate in NYC continued to decline past 500/yr. It literally took me 30 seconds to look that up and prove he was lying: http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_statistics/cs-en-us-city.pdf

I'm honestly trying to be open to his ideas but he just keeps spewing so much bullshit it's hard to take anything he says seriously."
845,3,"He can't help himself, he's so fucking petty - temperamentally unfit for office. "
846,3,"That's not true, he has the best temperament. A winning temperament. "
847,4,Didn't he say something like we all agree Rosie deserved it? 
848,3,They were asked to stay silent. They just didn't.
849,3,"Her ""it's a good line"" was fucking fantastic. "
850,3,Especially when you start arguing with a black man about the racist policies that were Stop and Frisk.  
851,3,"I was only listening to it on NPR, didn't know he was black. That makes it much more interesting."
852,1,"Yea, Lester Holt, the moderator, is a black man.  And he's a registered republican.  So it was especially fascinating when Trump accused him last week of being a democrat.  But then even more fascinating was that his campaign defended this error by saying that Trump didn't know that Holt was a republican, which of course begs the question as to how did Trump assume that Holt was a democrat? Because he's black? "
853,3,"This is patently false. Goldfish have perfectly average memory capabilities, and can even differentiate their owners/caretakers from other humans."
854,3,"My apologies to goldfish, lets say I was referring to the healthy cracker snack"
855,3,That was the knock-out punch.  Everything after that was him trying to get back up. 
856,3,One liner of the whole night for sure
857,2,This is the statement that will define why Hillary wins in November.
858,3,"""hey guys he gave us a shout out"""

860,3,Because they're not old enough to vote.
861,3,"Can you even imagine being her and hearing such horrible sexist shit about why you're unfit to be president? You don't look the part, you're mentally incompetent, etc... Glad she was able to respond to that garbagw"
862,4,she spent his time talking either smiling or looking like [this](http://67.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mb8x9iiu8q1rbzx9io2_1280.jpg)
863,3,The cocaine was wearing off towards the end and he was just getting cranky. 
864,3,"It's clearly Adderall, but yeah."
865,3,He's a creature of the 80s. I don't really think he was on coke but it wouldn't surprise me if he was because he felt he needed that old reliable boost. 
866,3,"He petered out about halfway through. It was quite amusing, you could see him get tired and frustrated."
867,4,"She definitely used her best zingers, like a greatest hits. That one, and ""the only secret is he has no plan.""  Hopefully her team comes up with new ones for the next debate. I agree with Trump that it's getting old almost as much as I agree with Hillary that it's a good one."
868,1,"Clinton basically apologising the world for Trump was actually funny, but him saying America shouldn't be a world police is also smart, but then he rambled forever"
869,3,We did! We're decided now.
870,3,I did. And now I'm not.
871,2,"Yeah, the opening handshake was good.  Then he greeted Hillary, and it was all downhill from there."
872,2,"Condescendingly asking if he could call her Secretary Clinton, and then using the word secretary in a seemingly pejorative sense throughout the debate made me angry. But Hillary's constant calm, earnest and cool attitude settled me down."
873,3,That sniffing was pretty annoying.
874,0,The crowd laughing at that was by far my favorite part of the debate.
875,1,The crowd kinda went back and forth with cheers and then Trump got laughed at and really I think that's when the election ended.
876,3,"> that's when the election ended.

or so we hope and pray"
877,3,"Exactly, hes so smart and composed, best temperament.  Yet cant stay on point, does nothing but rambles, interrupts and mocks.  Absolute shit show of a performance and I can't understand how people support someone with such little ideas on policy and what being the President actually means. 


Trump made Mitt Romney look like fucking Obama at this point."
878,3,"The funny thing is, it should've been clear months ago. 

"
879,0,[deleted]
880,4,I told a friend before the debate that there wasn't a lesser of the two evils. Now I feel like a fool. 
881,3,"Something, something, Marco Rubio. "
882,2,There was one but no follow up.  That said trump should have pivoted to that during his ramblings.  
883,2,Hillary admitted she was wrong. Trump doesn't understand how that works so he had no idea how to address it.
884,1,It seems that Trump started out restrained but got flustered and fell back into the Trump we all know. I guess what I'm saying is he doesn't have the stamina.
885,3,"The best was when she brought the lawsuits against him for not renting to black people. All he could say was, ""I never admitted guilt"" and that many other companies were being racist too."
886,1,"Yea, I thought Trump came off as... Trump"
887,2,"Ding ding, that's me. I genuinely don't remember that, I'm probably too young.

My early memories are her against Obama, and I found her lacking up against the passion that he always seemed to show.

His speeches gave me goosebumps, hers made me yawn. This was one of the first times I remember being excited about something she said."
888,3,"Fair enough, I'm excited to see it."
889,3,"When she called him out on being racist, I actually thought she had thrown him into an infinite loop of self-justifying denial."
890,3,I really liked him talking about how proud he was of opening a non-racist club in Palm Beach.
891,3,being a mom tends to prepare you for dealing with grumpy toddlers 
892,3,"Whatever she took before the event, I need a lifetime supply of."
893,3,It's her natural STAMINA
894,2,"Are we the same? I was on the well Hillary isn't trump train but after that, I can't help but smile after some of those one liners."
895,4,"You don't have to like her, but it's hard to admit this debate wasn't enjoyable in its own perverse way."
896,4,"I don't like either of them, but it was satisfying watching Donald act like it was the GOP debate and getting his ass handed to him."
897,2,"I said at the time how crazy the contrasts were.

Bernie and Hillary were deep in the weeds arguing over policy.

Trump and the repubs are calling each other names and comparing dick sizes.

It was insane. I still really don't know how we got here."
898,3,"to me she's kinda running on a ""4 year continuation of obama"" and im okay with the status quo"
899,3,"She's got a lot of sass, and I'm starting to admire it "
900,2,I hate trump so much I'm supporting hillary for the first time since 08
901,3,Thank Christ you guys are finally starting to come around.
902,3,A common symptom of space cancer
903,3,Indicates bad stamina!
904,1,"This really made me think Trump doesn't know what he is doing. Trump has been focus grouped widely and he is constantly referred to as unstable and impulsive. This is a flaw of his that some voters dont mind because they prefer his out of the box thinking and genuine style. Those are his strengths and weaknesses.


When he says ""I have the best temperament"" he just says something that voters know isn't true. He is talking as if he doesn't know or didn't study what voters think if him."
905,3,After his longest rant I swear she sighed a sigh of relief.
906,3,That hole just got 10ft deeper. 
907,3,Because facts don't matter.
908,3,I trust they'll find a way on /r/The_Donald.
909,2,"He wasn't even apologetic, he was glad to tell us all about how he was the one to get Obama to release his birth certificate and that blacks and Obama should be thanking him.  When he said that he helped the black community by forcing Obama to release his birth certificate my jaw was on the floor.  "
910,3,That's the voat vote. 
911,3,The candidates would never agree to it.
912,3,"I didn't think he could do anything to give Clinton more of the black vote, but Stop and Frisk was struck down as Unconstitutional for a reason. He's just so out of touch...."
913,3,Security is the most important part of Cyber.
914,3,And they told him! 
915,2,"And they said, they said to him:"
916,3,"You did a great, a really tremendous job. Believe me, folks!"
917,3,Says who?
918,2,I just said. All of them.
919,3,"ok, and your question is?"
920,3,This other time they caught a touchdown that was actually an interception.

>No, I didn’t say that at all. I don’t think you understood what was — this was locker room talk. I’m not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people. Certainly I’m not proud of it. But this is locker room talk.  You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have — and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times. We haven’t seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world. And they look and they see. Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS? And they look at our country and they see what’s going on. Yes, I’m very embarrassed by it. I hate it. But it’s locker room talk, and it’s one of those things. I will knock the hell out of ISIS. We’re going to defeat ISIS. ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment. And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS."
1011,3,"I have to imagine his campaign spent hours upon hours workshopping and drilling his response to that specific question.  I was expecting the most stock ""I'm sorry, but it's not that big of a deal, and Hillary is bad too"" answer.  Never once did it cross my mind that he would just start talking about ISIS.

One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet. But I have no loans with Russia.

That's just a bad tactical decision; it makes you look like you're hiding something."

That's actually a really good way to put it. Oftentimes I seriously can't understand what he's trying to say - he seems unable to organize his ideas logically. He's like a middle schooler writing an essay, just spitting out whatever comes to mind without any thesis or structure. "

**Trump: I can't think of any.**

1222,3,A military genius he is not. 
1223,3,"Trump hasn't spoken to Pence about Syria - like, at all? And then he throws Pence under the bus over it? Wow - I wonder if this means Pence will be dropping out. Pence wants the 2020 run, and wants it badly. Getting talked down by his own freaking running mate on national TV is bad news for that.

Edit: Apparently Pence is tweeting that he's still on board. It'll be funny to see what he says about this in interviews!"
1224,3,They communicate exclusively in locker room banter.
1225,3,Grab Syria by the pussy?
1226,3,Grabs Pence by the penis.

1233,3,"Question: What would you prioritize in naming a Supreme Court Justice?

Clinton: We want good people with real life experience. People who tried more cases, people who understand what folks have gone against.

Trump: I ask Sec. Clinton, why isn't she funding her campaign with her own money and not money from special interests? Why aren't you putting money in? You've made a lot of it because you were in office, in Sec State? Why not?


*what?*"
1234,1,"Mr Trump, you tweeted urging people to watch a sextape. Is that your idea of discipline?

""No I did not. Twitter is great. I have 25 million followers. Its a modern form of communication and its great.""

*What the fuck?*"
1235,3,"By the way, the tweet that contains the exact phrase ""check out sex tape"" still exists. "
1236,1,"> check out sex tape

I didn't even put in Trump's name.  I just searched for that phrase and the first link is an article with the tweet."
1237,3,"He told Cooper not to downplay Twitter as if he was asking if using Twitter at 3am was an example of good discipline, not even understanding that it was about telling people to look up a sex tape. "
1238,1,Trump didn't understand that the sex tape comment was the problem. You know since he's en enormous sexist. 
1239,3,"This was most rambling, incoherent performance by a presidential candidate I have ever witnessed."
1240,1,"Personally I think the discipline question was worse. Mr. Trump you tweeted to the public to check out a sex tape at 3am, is this good discipline?  
I never said sex tape! (he did) ... BENGHAZI"

Seriously. WTF."
1252,1,Same here.  I see far too many people saying Trump won and I just don't understand.  I thought he was awful.  I thought he crashed and burned.  His only decent answer was to the last question. 
1253,2,"It depends upon what you value - if you value information and facts than you think Hillary won. If you value bluster, you believe Trump won"
1254,3,He never answers the questions with any specifics or policy ideas. 
1255,3,Because he has none....
1256,3,"I'd say give him at least a little credit. He has ideas, they're just really bad and not thought out."
1257,4,"He has ideas of *outcomes* he'd like to see, but is missing that pesky part in the middle where you have to figure out how to get there. (Also his desired outcomes are horrifying)"

2. Lower taxes
3. ????
4. Profit"

1263,2,"Trump said he will have his political opposition imprisoned, threw Pence under the bus, and admitted not paying 20 years of federal taxes... But the debates a draw? Did we watch different debates?"
1264,1,The bar is set so freaking low by Trump that just the fact that he didn't take a swing at someone means that he did great in the eyes of most people.
1265,1,"This is the real ""mainstream media bias"" that Trump supporters are so eager to circlejerk about.

Clinton is held to an impossibly high standard and Trump is widely praised for not completely fucking up.

EDIT: CNN, in an effort to appear ""fair"" and not seem as if they were going after Trump for his complete meltdown this last week (e.g., violation of the Cuban embargo, illegal activity re: his charity) loaded the debate with questions about Clinton's emails, etc. which were already adequately addressed at the previous debate. It was a complete farce."

1274,3,"She never gives up.... But she has no stamina.


Ok Donald"
1275,3,At least he answered the question properly.
1276,4,"Guys, let's be real here. You can't like trump. Your whole defense of trump revolves around him being better than Hillary.

Sure a few diehards actually like his policy(or lack thereof) but you know that what you really like is that he isn't one of #them.

The #them that pervades American Politics. Politicians. He isn't Rubio. He isn't Cruz. He isn't Bush. He isn't Hillary. That's great. I like that he is different and I am happy that you are getting what you want.

But please think practically for a moment. He laid out next to #ZERO policy or planning. And he has shown himself as a terrible public speaker and personality. Foreign Governments who are our allies literally mock him in public. 

America needs someone who is strong and knows what they are doing. I am not a democrat. I identify as a progressive republican and a conservative socialist or something something of a mish mash. I am not a part of any party.

Please. He doesn't know what he is doing. And you can't justify that by saying Hilary is a bitch. "
1277,1,"> He laid out next to #ZERO policy or planning.

Not true at all! Trump clearly stated that his plan is to ditch the current plan and replace it with a plan that works. That's the plan."
1278,3,"Just because you hate the Heathers, doesn't mean you should let Christian Slater blow up the school. "
1279,3,"Welp...I think Donald just made Pence's decision on leaving that much easier...

EDIT - Holy shit Pence you need to get far away from this man"
1280,3,"No kidding... I mean, admitting to disagreeing with your running mate?

That's a good, clean shot in the foot right there."
1281,2,I'm more concerned with the fact that he said THEY HAD NEVER DISCUSSED THE TOPIC!  The candidates for President and VP from a major party haven't discussed one of the biggest issues facing the country???
1282,3,[removed]
1283,3,"Still no discussion on climate change

We're fucking destroying ourselves"
1284,2,"No in depth discussion, but Hillary gave a nod to it and talked about having an energy policy plan."
1285,1,"While Trump totally ignored the ""environmental' part of that question and instead talked about how he would make sure the fossil fuel industries made bigger profits.   "
1286,3,"Every election it's practically ignored, and it makes me sad. We don't deserve this planet"
1287,3,"It was touched upon briefly at the end, but not enough."
1288,3,"As a ""how will you save coal"" question. 

I work in the power industry and it pissed me off. Coal is dead. Let's dominate renewables. "
1289,3,"I took the question to be what will you do to help the coal workers, not how you will save coal."
1290,1,"True. Clinton hinted toward transition, Trump doubled down on coal"
1291,3,We fucking need a shock collar for when they go over by ten seconds and if they state wrong facts for the final debate. Also no audience because they clearly are incapable of being adults. 
1292,4,Do you want to be the one putting a shock collar on the future POTUS? Especially when one of them is talking about jailing people he doesn't like.
1293,3,Stupid question -why don't they just cut their mics? Give them a 10 sec grace period and you're done. Also no mic when it's not your turn. Watch interruptions go to zero. 
1294,1,"I think Rachel Maddows summed it up pretty good at the end saying, ""Trump promised he would jail his opponent if he won the election. Something we normally hear in countries we decry as authoritarian."" "
1295,3,Has somebody checked on Mike Pence? Is he alright?
1296,3,He is in the hospital getting the knife in his back taken out
1297,1,After this debate I'm confident Donald Trump does not know how the American government works. 
1298,3,"""Why didn't you, as a senator introduce tax legislation."" Ignorant of the fact that the House introduces tax bills."
1299,2,Ignorant at the fact that Hillary was not running the entire government for the last thirty years.
1300,2,Yeah this has been pretty mind blowing to me. He basically said that every senator ever has been shitty because they couldn't pass all the policy they preferred.
1301,2,"She should have repeated that she said, ""I voted to cut those loopholes but we had a Republican president.""  He spoke over that but it was a really good point!"
1302,1,"He wants to target uneducated voters by attaching everything ""corrupt/establishment/bad"" on Clinton. Any mistake the government has ever made: Clinton. Person who never makes a mistakes: Trump."
1303,3,"""Why weren't you running the entire government? All talk, no action folks. I will change that, believe me. Believe me."""
1304,3,"WAIT YOU MEAN AMERICA HASN'T BEEN LED BY THE JUNIOR SENATOR FROM NEW YORK FOR EIGHT YEARS!?

this changes everything..."
1305,3,But remember she's been fighting ISIS for her entire adult life.
1306,3,"Damn she should've jumped on it, ""Actually, Donald, the House of Representatives introduces tax bills -- did you know that?"""
1307,3,"But then people would have called her a condescending bitch. I think she handled it well enough. People know that as one person in the senate, you can't do it all... right?"
1308,1,You're putting a lot of faith in the 40~% of people voting for Trump.
1309,3,The problem is that his supporters don't either... so him saying stupid shit doesn't matter to them
1310,3,He thinks a senator can unilaterally make laws and change the tax code. He has no concept of even the most basic facts about our government. 
1311,3,"He probably knows that, but to a lot of people his argument will make sense."
1312,2,"If you showed this to someone not familiar with American politics, the person would think Hillary was president ever since 1992."
1313,3,You mean being a Senator doesn't make you dictator in chief? 
1314,3,and that's really where the biggest issue lies and is why Clinton is objectively a better choice.
1315,3,"I mean his bullshit about 30 years.  You mean as a single Senator, you couldnt unilaterally get the taxes fixed and pretty much every other problem with the country????  How can anyone be so damn naive WHEN THEY ARE RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY?"
1316,1,"That's cos Trump is just a reality TV host, he has no experience in politics. Trusting him to control a country is almost suicide."
1317,1,"It's so weird how people forget that.  They wouldn't trust the Kardashians to balance their checkbooks, but think Donald Trump can effectively lead the country.  

I don't really get it.  I understand the desire for something different, but Trump?  Really?"
1318,3,"Can't believe Senator Clinton didn't change the tax code.

if you own a single flag based piece of clothing, you do not have a choice in this election. **That flag stands for something. It stands for the United States Constitution, which Trump does not know anything about because the Founding Fathers forgot to write a pussy into it.**"
1321,2,"His ignorance on foreign policy is what kills me. He thinks we couldve just ""snuck into"" Mosul and taken it? The question given to Hillary asking if she would be for putting ground troops into Syria and she immediately said, ""no and that it would be a terrible mistake"" is how incredibly different these two people view the world. I am a veteran of Afghanistan and do not want the US sending in ground troops to any location that doesn't pose a direct threat to us. Putting in ground troops in this Syrian/Russian/Iran shit storm is incredibly naive and Trump thinks it's just that simple. Ban Muslims, tax breaks for corporations, and his vast ignorance on foreign policy... How in the hell can anyone consider voting for Trump? The dude is literally a suit-wearing, entitled, fascist cancer."
1322,3,"First of all, I think that you are entirely correct. I also am a veteran of Afghanistan and Trump seriously scares me. I posted this elsewhere, but I think that it should be a part of the conversation:

I think that it's important to remember that we are electing the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. For many years(understatement) we have struggled within our military to combat sexual harassment and assault. Even as recently as 2014 our military leaders have [specifically targeted ""what defense officials called 'locker room talk,' because those behaviors show a strong correlation to sexual assault.""](http://thehill.com/policy/defense/195083-military-cracks-down-on-locker-room-talk-at-academies) We need to consider and discuss what the effects of electing a Commander in Chief who makes comments advocating sexual assault, then justifies those remarks as ""locker room talk."" Not only does it tell our soldiers that it's alright to objectify and abuse women, but it justifies the broader scope of ""locker room talk"" which the military is already attempting to curtail. How can you tell a Private in the Army that he can't make sexually aggressive comments when he can go online and see the man at the top of his chain-of-command saying the exact same thing and excusing it as acceptable talk for men-among-men. You can't. The damage is already done and whether he was fit to be President or not, this alone should be enough to consider him unfit."
1323,4,"> A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SAID HIS FIRST ACT IN OFFICE WOULD BE TO START A TRUMPED-UP CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION TO LOCK UP HIS OPPONENT

The scary thing is that it seems like that was his supporters favorite part of the debate. "
1324,3,"""Mrs. Clinton, please tell the audience something that you respect about your opponent, your opponent that is on video boasting about using his star power to sexually assault women.""

There's a lot of internet back-patting for this question but, for all of the reasons that you have described, it was fucking absurd.

• No handshake surprised everyone I think. I wonder if their campaigns discussed this beforehand.

• Trump looked constipated and defeated from the get-go. Adopted a soft voice but couldn't help himself and settled into his usual aggression early on.

• Return of the sniffing.

• Anderson Cooper and Martha Raddatz came prepared and took no shit.

• A reality TV star dragged up rape claims against a former President in front of his wife and millions of people… and that cut to Bill's shocked face... what a time to be alive.

• So much petulance from Trump about time limits throughout. 

• ""If I were President at that time, [Captain Khan] would have been alive today.""

• Trump's genius military plan to defeat ISIS: ""Make it a sneak attack"".

• Probably the best soundbite of the night: ""Because you'll be in jail"".

• No knockout blow from Hillary but at this point her opponent has already been carried from the ring and is on his way to the morgue. 

• That last question. Name something positive that you respect about your opponent. Amazing. 
"

THIS is actually super important. The reason cities get warnings before they are attacked is so that civilians get the chance to flee should they choose to do so! It's a god damn humanitarian measure and I sooo wish Clinton would have mentioned it. Shows how little Trump knows or, even worse, how careless he is with the life of others.


Edit: I am told Raddatz mentioned it, which I missed and I think a lot of people did. It's a shame."
1370,3,"Yeah, but Raddatz mentioned it, so at least someone stood up for protecting innocent civilians.... "
1371,3,"Bizarrely the moderator mentioned it, which was nice. "
1372,2,"I know the moderator called him out on it, and I think they didn't give Hillary a chance to respond to that directly.

good job with the good talking, trump"
1390,1,As an independent I thought Clinton did well. Trump really didn't answer any questions. Clinton isn't emotional but at this point I rather take her than Trump.
1391,3,Not emotional is a good trait for a leader to have imo
1392,3,Do we want an emotional president?
1393,3,Lmao that was my reaction too reading the comment. 
1394,1,Trump never answers questions
1395,4,"I feel like ""isn't emotional"" is a good quality."
1396,3,"As someone who has always associated myself more closely with the political right (albeit not on social issues), I still can't believe the GOP nominated Trump, the epitome of all the negative stereotypes liberals and Democrats have of the GOP. I can't wait for November 8th- I hope it truly destroys the ambitions of this segment of the political right in the US for at least a decade."
1397,2,"I'm a Republican who is voting for Hillary after seeing the debate. I'm not alone; some of my more conservative friends and family are as well. Previously, I wasn't voting at all. I don't agree with some of her policies, but Trump is a nightmare. I can't stand by and watch him become our next President."
1398,4,Donald Trump sounded like me when I haven't bothered to prepare for a presentation and I'm just BSing my way through it.
1399,4,"it's so irksome to see people complaining about the candidates not talking policy and placing the blame equally on both their shoulders.

like, how can anyone seriously think that Hillary wouldn't **love** to discuss the differences in their tax plans or healthcare plans or in-depth foreign policy? but meanwhile, Trump is showing up to the debate trying to get Bill Clinton's possible-rape-victims placed in the ""family box"" on stage."
1400,3,A campaign manager just had to clarify that she's never been assaulted or harassed in a sexual manner by the candidate whose campaign she's managing. She also used that fact to say the candidate is not a bad guy.
1401,0,"[FiveThirtyEight's interruption count for the second debate is in!](https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/debate-interruptions-2.png?w=575)

Shocking spoiler: Trump interrupted way more than Clinton."
1402,4,"I like how one of the few times Hillary even did interrupt, she apologized for it. "
1403,3,So trump got a question from an old dude about being inclusive and started going on about the inner city because old dude happened to be black?
1404,1,Legitimate query:  Did Trump answer a single direct question?  He kept deflecting all over the place.
1405,3,"That last question at the end was glorious.

Cheers to you Karl Becker"
1406,0,"How we all feel:

1407,1,"ITT: Trump shit in his hand, but since he didn't throw it at the audience, he clearly won."
1408,1,TRUMP SOLVED IT. We need an overnight sneak attack to defeat ISIS! I will tell Putin of this genius plan. No way he could come up with that!
1409,1,"From the WP transcript:

>RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, let me repeat the question. If you were president...

1410,3,"Locker room talk: Did you check out sara's top today? omg, yess... would love to motorboat those.

NOT

I motorboated sara
WHAT
Yep, caught her in the copying room, shut the door, just grabbed her by the pussy and motorboated those puppies.
DAAAAMN. I don't know man...
Nah, she ain't gonna do nothing. If she wants her job.

LOL haha lol hah yea. yea. okay. "
1411,3,"Real Locker Room Talk: ""Hey, did you see that jackass on the debates last night?""  ""Yea, he's a piece of shit."" "
1412,1,"I'm a NeverTrump conservative Republican. I think Clinton won yet again. Trump ran all over the place with multiple tangents. He threw his own VP under the bus and reversed what he said concerning Russia last week. Trump praised dictators in Russia and Syria. 

It might have been good enough to stop the GOP support bleeding from him. But that probably hurts the Republican Party more than it helps. If he had totally imploded, we would probably be in better positioned to either try to oust him (and fail) or pull the plug on his campaign. "
1413,3,Can we just take a moment to thank Anderson Cooper for picking that last question in such a nasty election?
1414,3,"His answer on Islamophobia was disturbing. He basically blames Islam for it, then repeatedly says Muslims need to keep an eye on each other and report suspicious behavior. That is not a policy, nor a solution to Islamophobia, that is authoritarian ""report your neighbors"" fearmongering."
1415,1,"I have an honest question, does Trump know that the senate is filled with more than one person?  Instead of attacking what she didn't pass why not attack what she voted for?"
1416,3,"One of the 2016 presidential candidates doesn't even know how the senate works. 

...I'm scared for this country."
1417,1,"Donald Trump: I want another Justice in the mold of Justice Scalia.

The entire US: Is it Madam President or Madame President?"
1418,3,I just know the minute I close my laptop for the night something fucking epic will explode. This is a problem.
1419,2,"A debate director analyzing debate performance on CNN just said that Trump was sniffing louder than any ""coke fiend he's ever known.""

Someone has to get a clip of that to put online."
1420,1,Trump has always had frightening policies but this is the first time that I saw Trump and he made me exceedingly uncomfortable and frightened. I just couldn't sit still while he was talking and he just made me anxious and twitchy.
1421,3,When he kept talking about how we should do a sneaky secret mission in the middle of the night to kill all the leaders I couldn't take it. You don't think we would have done that if we could? 
1422,2,"I just have to say, Hillary must have nerves of steel to be completely unfazed by everything Trump had to say about her. I guess dealing with republicans for 20+ has made her immune to anything they throw at her.  "
1423,1,"Trump focused way too much on Hilary as a person and everything he critiqued about her actual policy was either misleading, off-base or a flat-out lie."
1424,3,"He doesn't have much in the way of policy anyway. It was always, ""I can do better. Trust me."""
1425,3,"Kenneth Bone is the hero we deserve, but not the hero we need right now."
1426,3,"Have people really lowered their standards so far that Trump not dropping an N-bomb is enough for them to say he did well? He has no plans, no policies, and as much understanding of politics both international and domestic as my 8 year old niece. He casually threw out insults in the hope that he could make her cry and claim victory by doing so and when he attempted to discuss the issues he come off as being marginally less insane the average ranting homeless man. What debate are people watching where they can say he did well or won?"
1427,1,Trump's response to combating Islamophobia was Islamophobic. 
1428,1,Who saw that tweet where Trump called hillary the devil and a lady in the undecided voter section just reacted negatively. I can imagine most of the female voters were extremely turned off by Trump tonight. 
1429,3,"Quote from CNN: ""We can both be against ISIS and against rape."""
1430,3,"Let's not forget ""clean coal"", what a joke."
1431,3,"Cory Lewandowski getting heckled by the crowd on CNN - ""get him out of here!""

Anyone else hearing that?"
1432,3,"The last question was pretty good. I was really hoping one of them would just say, ""Nothing."" and drop the mic on the stage and walk the hell out."
1433,2,"According to a CNN poll 57% of people thought Hillary won 34% thought Trump won. 

Now I'm not sure but my guess is the other 9% were unable to vote as they probably died of alcohol overdose before the debate ended... 

"
1434,4,Clinton yet again comes off as well-educated and informed and Donald looks like he is just going to wing this whole presidential thing.
1435,3,I think the Mike Pence bit is going to hit republican supporters hard.
1436,0,I think that is something that gets worse in the day after the debate compared to immediately 
1437,3,What happens if a VP quits before the election? Has that ever happened?
1438,1,"I keep reading that Trump didn't have a meltdown and Clinton was the same as always but missed a few opportunities so it was more or less a tie.....am I missing something?? Clinton lays out a comprehensive knowledge of global issues, and comprehensive plans for how to handle things in America. Trump doesn't really answer questions, spends most of his time being critical of what has happened with no nuance, and when he does lay out something, it's like a jot note in lieu of a plan and it's either to give rich people more money and fewer regulations which will somehow magically benefit the low and middle class, or by creating more competition with those lower taxes prices for stuff will be kept low. Am I crazy, or isn't that all that's being said in amongst the gibberish? And don't we already know that neither of those things work? And if all that is true, then how was that a tie?"
1439,4,I 100% agree. I feel like I watched a different debate than everyone. He didn't lay out a single plan or really answer a question. Even if you don't like Hillary at least she attempts to tell you her plans.
1440,1,"Yes! I don't ""like"" Hillary, but I dislike her slightly less each time I watch one of these for the simple fact that she obviously works really hard at doing the work that's required. I would much prefer a more left-leaning candidate, but at least she understands how the different levels of American government work, and is aware of the complexities of international issues. 

I want to hope that in the next 24 hours of sound bites it'll be very clear that Trump didn't answer a bunch of really important questions, and that he's very much out of his league. I want to hope that. But NBC's first comment was about Trump pressing Hillary about Bill, so it might just be another shit show. 

*edit: too dumb to spell after having been exposed to Trump for an hour and a half"
1441,3,"Again, let's be clear, that was not locker room talk. That is not what most guys say, nor how they act, even in private. It says something about the men who agree that's normal. As a guy, I'm offended. "
1442,4,"Trumps wants to throw political enemies in jail, just being a strong leader like Putin"
1443,3,"Amazing how Trump completely dodged the question regarding his little ""locker room talk"" video. He just transitions into talking about ISIS--really? Is this a fucking South Park sketch? How do people back this man?"
1444,4,"How long is Pence gonna put up with his abuse?  Don't like the guy, but holy fuck.  Wasn't expecting that."
1445,3,"""I consider that a great compliment. I don't know if it was intended to be...""

What a pathetic move. So obviously attempting to incite conflict in response to a comment that clearly reflected how incredibly sick of conflict we all are. It's just the perfect example of how inflammatory and petty he is."
1446,3,Nobody is talking about the fact he admitted that he paid zero taxes.
1447,3,"I think undecided women voters are really going to side with Hilary after this one.  The way he was talking to her, standing behind her looking down at her, pointing at her, was just really fucking creepy."
1448,1,"CNN poll: Trump beat low expectations, Clinton still beat him solidly."
1449,1,The Trump N word video to be dropped tomorrow am.
1450,3,Kelly Anne is going to end up aging as much in these few months as Obama did in his 8 years.
1451,3,The way he was awkwardly pacing up and down and having a weird body language really bothered me. Talk about looking presidential. 
1452,3,"Did anyone else notice that Donald was sniffing a lot more during this debate than the last one or are my speakers playing up?

(I'm not saying he has a substance abuse problem. Or maybe he does.  A lot of people are saying that,  I don't know, I'm hearing it from smart people, the best people. Folks, believe me.)

But Donald. Can you actually give us a reason to vote for you other than shit talking the left/Hillary? Can you give us *any* substance that isnt hyperbole. "
1455,3,[removed]
1456,3,"I still can't believe that a major party candidate has gotten in front of the country twice and when asked anything about policy, just responds with ""Believe me.""

Fucking why? Why should anyone believe anything you say? Who on his staff told him to just go out and wing it? This is insulting as a voter. "
1457,4,That has to be one of the worst debate performances that I've ever seen. Trump didn't even answer most of the questions and behaved like an angsty teenager. 
1458,0,[deleted]
1459,3,"CNN showing a ""Fat Check Him"" sign in the background LOL"
1460,3,Why doesn't anybody mention that he has no ideas? He didn't put forward a single policy. 
1461,1,"Trump: If I don't grab the pussies, ISIS will. Make America great again."
1462,3,He called Mexicans murderers and drug dealers. Again. *Again*.
1463,3,And black people ONLY live in inner cities.

1470,3,"They're so totally doing that next week.

And the fly."
1471,3,I hope they can get Jeff Goldblum to reprise the role.
1472,3,I thought the fly was in our house
1473,3,I seriously had to ask someone if the fly actually landed on her face or if it was just on my TV.
1474,3,Welcome to the Westworld
1475,4,"Honestly that was a first in US history in terms of pure bloodbath debates. I doubt we will ever see anything like that again. 

The fact that we are here with these two candidates is proof that like it or not, there is some divide in this country.

I can't believe I just watched that. "
1476,0,Well there is a third debate. We may see worse!
1477,3,"Recent history, maybe. You're forgetting 18th and 19th century debates where Congressmen would beat each other with sticks and challenge each other to pistol duels."
1478,3,"Seriously, has no one read a single history book? If people think this was even remotely a ""bloody debate"" they're incredibly uninformed. "
1479,1,"Yeah, Andrew Jackson would beat Trump over the head with his cane. And then Aaron Burr would shoot him."
1480,1,"Jackson might support the whole ""send the illegals packing"" thing, though. Although in a much more violent fashion than I imagine Donald Trump plans.

1493,2,"I liked it how Trump said ""Electing Hillary would be like four more years of Obama."". 


Obama is enjoying some extremely high approval ratings right now..."
1494,3,"That's his answer to every question. ""Things are bad, so bad. I will fix them by being gooder. So much gooder."""
1495,3,Bigly gooder.

1499,3,He'd rejigger the government. 
1500,3,"I have to imagine his campaign spent hours upon hours workshopping and drilling his response to that specific question.  I was expecting the most stock ""I'm sorry, but it's not that big of a deal, and Hillary is bad too"" answer.  Never once did it cross my mind that he would just start talking about ISIS.  My jaw was hanging open during the whole answer."
1501,3,"I don't know, this one was great too:    
""I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office. One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet. But I have no loans with Russia. You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have."""

1509,3,Not entirely true! He also told a Muslim lady that she needs to report it whenever she sees bombs being made in her fellow Muslims' homes.

1520,3,What was the question and general replies? I was flying and missed that portion. 
1521,1,"Final question was to name something they respected about each other. Hillary respects Trump's children, Trump respects how Hillary never gives up.

Only question Trump answered well IMO."
1522,2,"I thought they were both ok answers in terms of their content, but that Hillary framed her answer poorly. She should have said that she respects Trump because he has done well by his children and they have turned out to be wonderful people or something rather than starting with ""I respect his children""."
1523,3,"She complimented in such a way that it couldn't be cut and used in a commercial, but they couldn't say she didn't compliment."

1525,3,It showed us a side to this election that I wish we saw more often.
1526,3,Actual civility.
1527,4,"The side of the election that I want to see more often is policy discussion. What direction that each candidate wants to take the country. They did a little of that but not nearly enough. Complimenting each other is not that. This debate, like the others, is theater.  Pandering to misinformed and ignorant ""undecideds"". 

Really? You're still undecided with such a contrast on stances? Or maybe undecideds don't want either, which I could see. But this is America, you only get TWO dumb choices. I expect many disenfranchised voters to skip the poles which is an advantage for Trump. "

One of the biggest aspects of ""locker room talk"" is bragging about things that never happened. So Cooper gives him an easy opportunity to clarify and deny ever actually assaulting women.

1581,4,"Well if she'd interrupted halfway through, he could have said ""I'm getting to that"", and if he actually had it would have looked like he was being attacked. Waiting until he ""answered"" first removed that option for him."
1582,3,"""Sure, and let me ignore it again."""
1583,1,"It just shows how much Trump *hasn't thought* about how he would actually implement his policies.

Guess what: you don't become President and become supreme dictator.  You need to work with people *gasp*!  I honestly think he doesn't realize this, and this is why he makes ridiculous promises."
1584,4,"He doesn't seem to understand the very basics of how government works. This is like a mechanic walking into a hospital and demanding they let him do open heart surgery. Like, yeah, there's valves involved in both, but there's a reason we require qualifications for important jobs."
1585,4,"Oh, I miss Bernie's old man humor. I like the Hillary shimmy, but he's just more natural."
1586,1,Trump's still got a firm grab on that pussy so he's not going anywhere. 
1587,3,"Yeah, he talks as if the military should be slapping their foreheads and saying, ""Oh, of COURSE! Why haven't we thought of that yet?!"" 

Insane."
1588,3,"I can't picture this man being commander in chief. ""Yes, we should also train our soldiers to point and yell 'Hey look over there!'"""
1589,3,Not to mention giving civilians a 0% chance of being able to get out alive.
1590,3,"""Surprise! White phosphorus!"""
1591,4,"Not to mention that a sneak attack would not give time for innocent people to flee. 

Not like Trump would consider that in the first place though. "
1592,1,"They're not innocent though! They're terrorists! 

---Trump, probably. "
1593,0,"Third debate: ""Sometimes she is energized and focused, some times she is not!"" "
1594,2,"And he said ""you can go first, I'm a gentleman"" and they laughed. "
1595,3,"""See, they're laughing with me"""
1596,2,"He held up the microphone and opened his mouth before the question was even done. Hillary sniped him for it, then he pulls a sexist comment. Classic."
1597,0,Watched the debate at a bar. That's literally what happened.
1598,2,I was watching the debate in a crowded theater and I have no idea what anyone said after that because everyone was laughing hysterically.
1599,3,"The first two or three ""answers"" were by far the worst. It reminded me of an essay question on a test where you want to make sure you've said all the important things the teacher is going to look for, so you ramble on about everything you know for 5 pages just in case. "
1600,3,It brought to mind cover letters you write to apply for a job where you know they will be run through a keyword match program. Just shovel all the buzzwords in there to wedge your foot in.

1606,3,"For most of his answers, I could see where he was trying to go, when he was trying to pivot, etc., but this one...does *anyone* have the slightest idea what this word salad means?"
1607,3,Seems to be trying to say that one of his companies was given a contract to do/redo the old post office building in some fashion and that is somehow proof that he pays taxes and has no weird and/or conflicting business concerns. As if they choose a company based solely on their financials ( a weird thing to suggest) and that somehow his personal tax and money issues would be a part of company financial documents. It's a weird nonsensical point. It's so absurd it's more incriminating than saying nothing about it.
1608,2,Shit I thought I must have vagued out when he said that and missed his point. Nope. Incoherent.

1611,3,"IIRC, clean coal was just a marketing term used to describe a scrubbing process by a coal lobby group but they used in their tv commercials to make it sound like somebody invented a whole new kind of coal."

The director may have told the cameraperson to refocus the camera (which is done by zooming in and focusing on the subject's eye, hence the fast zoom in) but then told the tech director too late.

1643,0,"They had them on the walls in the debate hall, but you could only occasionally see them."
1644,3,"I think he meant for total time spent talking, not the two minute clock. Might be wrong though"
1645,4,"He was trying to set up the ""it's rigged against me"" narrative mid debate this time, instead of waiting to see his critical reception like with the first debate."

1650,3,"I can't hear him talk anymore. My brain just wants to devour itself trying to untie all the verbal knots he makes when speaking. Even when someone gives him a jumping-off point, he response bears no relevance to what was asked. "
1651,4,"> My brain just wants to devour itself


That's actually a really good way to put it. Oftentimes I seriously can't understand what he's trying to say - he seems unable to organize his ideas logically. He's like a middle schooler writing an essay, just spitting out whatever comes to mind without any thesis or structure. "
1652,4,"When grading, that stuff is just given the lowest grade, writes a vague comment like ""Needs to organize thoughts more clearly"" and the teacher moves on to the next essay. Seriously, I've seen way more coherent essays from students with English as their third language, or students with PTSD. Trump is just all over the place and each fragment of a thought has no relevance to anything else."
1653,3,That's because he is not actually educated on the issues and is skirting around them waiting for the clock to run out.
1654,3,I think the only actual thing he discussed policy wise was getting rid of state borders for health insurers.

1659,3,"He complained about Clinton going ""a minute over"" on a question she spent 1:52 on. "
1660,4,"Wow,  it did feel like Hillary did go over her time a lot but it's probably because Trump would always interrupt during her time. "
1661,1,"> And Trump kept complaining about it..

Worked so well for Lincoln Chafee"
1662,3,"He tried to, but kept interrupting whenever it mentioned 'bill'"
1663,3,"""Wrong"""

1665,1,"If Trump didn't have to have a VP, I'm sure he wouldn't have one. Pence is just a formality to him."
1666,3,Most already have their minds made up. Doubt any of this impacts either side much.

1673,3,Pence: *Ooh* I would knock her up so *bad*. Then deny her abortion rights. 
1674,4,"""I haven't spoken to him and we don't agree"" or something like that. My jaw dropped. Not that anything he says is really a surprise at this point"
1675,3,"Well, Pence just posted this on Twitter""  Congrats to my running mate @realDonaldTrump on a big debate win! Proud to stand with you as we #MAGA."
1676,1,"It would be an amazing Frank Underwood move. 

Undercut Trump sealing him losing the nomination and pushing yourself to the front of the 2020 race. "
1677,3,"A four-year power play? Frank Underwood moves faster than that, IMO."
1678,1,"Mr Trump, you tweeted urging people to watch a sextape. Is that your idea of discipline?

""No I did not. Twitter is great. I have 25 million followers. Its a modern form of communication and its great.""

*What the fuck?*"
1679,3,"By the way, the tweet that contains the exact phrase ""check out sex tape"" still exists. "
1680,1,"> check out sex tape

I didn't even put in Trump's name.  I just searched for that phrase and the first link is an article with the tweet."
1681,3,"He told Cooper not to downplay Twitter as if he was asking if using Twitter at 3am was an example of good discipline, not even understanding that it was about telling people to look up a sex tape. "
1682,1,Trump didn't understand that the sex tape comment was the problem. You know since he's en enormous sexist. 
1683,3,"This was most rambling, incoherent performance by a presidential candidate I have ever witnessed."
1684,1,"Personally I think the discipline question was worse. Mr. Trump you tweeted to the public to check out a sex tape at 3am, is this good discipline?  
I never said sex tape! (he did) ... BENGHAZI"
1685,3,"Jesus.

Fuck.

Yes.

I haven't watched all that many debates (I only became a citizen in 2008) but ...that was...in its own league, right?"
1686,3,its unbelievable that he managed to get this far
1687,3,"Yes, this election has been.... Exceptional.

You picked an awkward time to join up but... Uh.... Welcome!"
1688,3,Yes it was insane.
1689,3,"Yeah, this whole election has been a special kind of stupid"
1690,3,"Especially the two sentences at some point about a post office, balance sheet and Pennsylvania Avenue or something. It literally made no sense."
1691,3,"Don't forget about his ""beautifully reviewed judges"""

1693,3,My response to his every response. 
1694,3,"""Did you sexually assault anyone?""

""ISIS"""
1695,3,"""Did you pay taxes?""

""ISIS!!!!!!!!!!!""

Seriously. WTF."
1696,1,Same here.  I see far too many people saying Trump won and I just don't understand.  I thought he was awful.  I thought he crashed and burned.  His only decent answer was to the last question. 
1697,2,"It depends upon what you value - if you value information and facts than you think Hillary won. If you value bluster, you believe Trump won"
1698,3,He never answers the questions with any specifics or policy ideas. 
1699,3,Because he has none....
1700,3,"I'd say give him at least a little credit. He has ideas, they're just really bad and not thought out."
1701,4,"He has ideas of *outcomes* he'd like to see, but is missing that pesky part in the middle where you have to figure out how to get there. (Also his desired outcomes are horrifying)"
1702,4,"1. Kick out people I don't like and build wall.
2. Lower taxes
3. ????
4. Profit"
1703,3,Deflect and insult. That's his only strategy bc he has nothing to say
1704,2,"Another thing I noticed is that Trump wasn't looking at the people who asked the question and stood pretty far from them. Hillary went straight to the edge of the circle, looked the people in their eyes, and talked. "
1705,3,Cocaine and cocaine accessories. 
1706,1,The bar is set so freaking low by Trump that just the fact that he didn't take a swing at someone means that he did great in the eyes of most people.
1707,1,"This is the real ""mainstream media bias"" that Trump supporters are so eager to circlejerk about.

Clinton is held to an impossibly high standard and Trump is widely praised for not completely fucking up.

EDIT: CNN, in an effort to appear ""fair"" and not seem as if they were going after Trump for his complete meltdown this last week (e.g., violation of the Cuban embargo, illegal activity re: his charity) loaded the debate with questions about Clinton's emails, etc. which were already adequately addressed at the previous debate. It was a complete farce."
1708,3,But she has no sta-mi-na
1709,3,"He thought he might score some points by not answering the last question in the same way Clinton did (she does not do short answers well at all), but candidates have to use that last debate question as a signoff to the American audience until next time. He just signed off with ""She's got guts and she's tenacious,"" without contrasting himself as the right choice in the very next breath."
1710,2,"He started it by saying, ""I agree with everything she said."""
1711,3,At least he answered the question properly.
1712,1,"> He laid out next to #ZERO policy or planning.

Not true at all! Trump clearly stated that his plan is to ditch the current plan and replace it with a plan that works. That's the plan."
1713,3,"Just because you hate the Heathers, doesn't mean you should let Christian Slater blow up the school. "
1714,3,"No kidding... I mean, admitting to disagreeing with your running mate?

That's a good, clean shot in the foot right there."
1715,2,I'm more concerned with the fact that he said THEY HAD NEVER DISCUSSED THE TOPIC!  The candidates for President and VP from a major party haven't discussed one of the biggest issues facing the country???
1716,2,"No in depth discussion, but Hillary gave a nod to it and talked about having an energy policy plan."
1717,1,"While Trump totally ignored the ""environmental' part of that question and instead talked about how he would make sure the fossil fuel industries made bigger profits.   "
1718,3,"Every election it's practically ignored, and it makes me sad. We don't deserve this planet"
1719,3,"It was touched upon briefly at the end, but not enough."
1720,3,"As a ""how will you save coal"" question. 

I work in the power industry and it pissed me off. Coal is dead. Let's dominate renewables. "
1721,3,"I took the question to be what will you do to help the coal workers, not how you will save coal."
1722,1,"True. Clinton hinted toward transition, Trump doubled down on coal"
1723,4,Do you want to be the one putting a shock collar on the future POTUS? Especially when one of them is talking about jailing people he doesn't like.
1724,3,Stupid question -why don't they just cut their mics? Give them a 10 sec grace period and you're done. Also no mic when it's not your turn. Watch interruptions go to zero. 
1725,3,He is in the hospital getting the knife in his back taken out
1726,3,"""Why didn't you, as a senator introduce tax legislation."" Ignorant of the fact that the House introduces tax bills."
1727,2,Ignorant at the fact that Hillary was not running the entire government for the last thirty years.
1728,2,Yeah this has been pretty mind blowing to me. He basically said that every senator ever has been shitty because they couldn't pass all the policy they preferred.
1729,2,"She should have repeated that she said, ""I voted to cut those loopholes but we had a Republican president.""  He spoke over that but it was a really good point!"
1730,1,"He wants to target uneducated voters by attaching everything ""corrupt/establishment/bad"" on Clinton. Any mistake the government has ever made: Clinton. Person who never makes a mistakes: Trump."
1731,3,"""Why weren't you running the entire government? All talk, no action folks. I will change that, believe me. Believe me."""
1732,3,"WAIT YOU MEAN AMERICA HASN'T BEEN LED BY THE JUNIOR SENATOR FROM NEW YORK FOR EIGHT YEARS!?

this changes everything..."
1733,3,But remember she's been fighting ISIS for her entire adult life.
1734,3,"Damn she should've jumped on it, ""Actually, Donald, the House of Representatives introduces tax bills -- did you know that?"""
1735,3,"But then people would have called her a condescending bitch. I think she handled it well enough. People know that as one person in the senate, you can't do it all... right?"
1736,1,You're putting a lot of faith in the 40~% of people voting for Trump.
1737,3,The problem is that his supporters don't either... so him saying stupid shit doesn't matter to them
1738,3,He thinks a senator can unilaterally make laws and change the tax code. He has no concept of even the most basic facts about our government. 
1739,3,"He probably knows that, but to a lot of people his argument will make sense."
1740,2,"If you showed this to someone not familiar with American politics, the person would think Hillary was president ever since 1992."
1741,3,You mean being a Senator doesn't make you dictator in chief? 
1742,3,and that's really where the biggest issue lies and is why Clinton is objectively a better choice.
1743,3,"I mean his bullshit about 30 years.  You mean as a single Senator, you couldnt unilaterally get the taxes fixed and pretty much every other problem with the country????  How can anyone be so damn naive WHEN THEY ARE RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY?"
1744,1,"That's cos Trump is just a reality TV host, he has no experience in politics. Trusting him to control a country is almost suicide."
1745,1,"It's so weird how people forget that.  They wouldn't trust the Kardashians to balance their checkbooks, but think Donald Trump can effectively lead the country.  

I don't really get it.  I understand the desire for something different, but Trump?  Really?"
1746,3,"Can't believe Senator Clinton didn't change the tax code.

/s"
1747,3,Anderson Cooper should have asked him how many senators there are.
1748,3,"This is why I got a little mad at the last question. I get that [ordinary American salt of the earth types](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJbSvidohg) like to circlejerk about how **Both Sides Are Bad And Tearing Down Our Discourse With Those Negative Attack Ads** but

if you own a single flag based piece of clothing, you do not have a choice in this election. **That flag stands for something. It stands for the United States Constitution, which Trump does not know anything about because the Founding Fathers forgot to write a pussy into it.**"
1749,2,"His ignorance on foreign policy is what kills me. He thinks we couldve just ""snuck into"" Mosul and taken it? The question given to Hillary asking if she would be for putting ground troops into Syria and she immediately said, ""no and that it would be a terrible mistake"" is how incredibly different these two people view the world. I am a veteran of Afghanistan and do not want the US sending in ground troops to any location that doesn't pose a direct threat to us. Putting in ground troops in this Syrian/Russian/Iran shit storm is incredibly naive and Trump thinks it's just that simple. Ban Muslims, tax breaks for corporations, and his vast ignorance on foreign policy... How in the hell can anyone consider voting for Trump? The dude is literally a suit-wearing, entitled, fascist cancer."
1750,3,"First of all, I think that you are entirely correct. I also am a veteran of Afghanistan and Trump seriously scares me. I posted this elsewhere, but I think that it should be a part of the conversation:

I think that it's important to remember that we are electing the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. For many years(understatement) we have struggled within our military to combat sexual harassment and assault. Even as recently as 2014 our military leaders have [specifically targeted ""what defense officials called 'locker room talk,' because those behaviors show a strong correlation to sexual assault.""](http://thehill.com/policy/defense/195083-military-cracks-down-on-locker-room-talk-at-academies) We need to consider and discuss what the effects of electing a Commander in Chief who makes comments advocating sexual assault, then justifies those remarks as ""locker room talk."" Not only does it tell our soldiers that it's alright to objectify and abuse women, but it justifies the broader scope of ""locker room talk"" which the military is already attempting to curtail. How can you tell a Private in the Army that he can't make sexually aggressive comments when he can go online and see the man at the top of his chain-of-command saying the exact same thing and excusing it as acceptable talk for men-among-men. You can't. The damage is already done and whether he was fit to be President or not, this alone should be enough to consider him unfit."
1751,4,"> A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SAID HIS FIRST ACT IN OFFICE WOULD BE TO START A TRUMPED-UP CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION TO LOCK UP HIS OPPONENT

The scary thing is that it seems like that was his supporters favorite part of the debate. "
1752,3,"""Mrs. Clinton, please tell the audience something that you respect about your opponent, your opponent that is on video boasting about using his star power to sexually assault women.""

There's a lot of internet back-patting for this question but, for all of the reasons that you have described, it was fucking absurd. 
"
1753,3,The last one
1754,3,"So long, and thanks for all the fish!"
1755,2,He hardly even acknowledged those that asked the questions. He would just stare into the camera or point at Hillary. Extremely disrespectful to the town hall process. 
1756,3,He also called her the devil.
1757,2,"He also said he hadn't talked with, and disagreed with, his running mate on a major issue."
1758,3,"An issue that he was asked twice about, after giving a long, rambling non-answer the first time. "
1759,2,"I honestly burst out laughing when he said ""she has evil in her heart."" Totally absurd
"
1760,3,"That was the one that got me too.

If I remember correctly, it's what got the biggest laugh out of Clinton too. Who can blame her?"
1761,2,"He said she had hate in her heart. In a Trump op ed he about those 5 teens that were accused of murdering a woman he said something like ""Maybe what America needs is more hate"". "
1762,3,"Moreover, that he would *personally* arrange for it."
1763,3,"Thank you for choosing country over party, or over a single issue.

I sincerely appreciate it."
1764,3,"Rational human, and I agree."
1765,3,"Yes, yes he did. "
1766,3,"""I never intended to be president. My campaign was about bringing people together with a cause."""

THIS is actually super important. The reason cities get warnings before they are attacked is so that civilians get the chance to flee should they choose to do so! It's a god damn humanitarian measure and I sooo wish Clinton would have mentioned it. Shows how little Trump knows or, even worse, how careless he is with the life of others.


Edit: I am told Raddatz mentioned it, which I missed and I think a lot of people did. It's a shame."
1776,3,"Yeah, but Raddatz mentioned it, so at least someone stood up for protecting innocent civilians.... "
1777,3,"Bizarrely the moderator mentioned it, which was nice. "
1778,2,"I know the moderator called him out on it, and I think they didn't give Hillary a chance to respond to that directly. I, too, was hoping she'd mention that the reason cities are given advance notice is to evac civilians, and then follow up with, ""Osama bin Laden was given his notice in-person."""
1779,3,"Best soundbite was

""So why didn't you?""

""Because I had a Republican President."""
1780,3,Also if a single senator can just make really important shit happen on their own that would be bad because that means that a single senator could make everything to to hell on their own.
1781,3,"And after he sniffled that she would have made it happen if she were a strong Senator

""We have a little thing in this country called the President having a veto..."""
1782,3,"I dunno I personally loved ""I'm a gentleman"" (and then that getting a laugh from the audience, holy shit!) and ""nobody has more respect for women than me"""
1783,3,He really demonstrated how little he knows in regards to how government actually functions on that one.
1784,3,They did shake hands at the end. 
1785,3,Would have been pretty hard to go from a question about complimenting your opponent to not even shaking hands with them

1787,3,"He has terrible breath control. He's talking out his mouth, runs out of breath and inhales sharply to continue speaking. If he would simply slow down and catch his breath he wouldn't have to sniff so hard."
1788,2,"He had a terrible mic, just terrible. Once again he was sabotaged by the sound technicians, who decided to give him a terrible mic that was good enough to pick up his breathing!

Probably because they're Hillary supporters who were stiffed by Trump by doing a bad job for him.

/sarcasm"
1789,3,Not emotional is a good trait for a leader to have imo
1790,3,Do we want an emotional president?
1791,3,Lmao that was my reaction too reading the comment. 
1792,1,Trump never answers questions
1793,4,"I feel like ""isn't emotional"" is a good quality."
1794,4,"I like how one of the few times Hillary even did interrupt, she apologized for it. "
1795,3,"He doesn't have much in the way of policy anyway. It was always, ""I can do better. Trust me."""
1796,0,I think that is something that gets worse in the day after the debate compared to immediately 
1797,4,I 100% agree. I feel like I watched a different debate than everyone. He didn't lay out a single plan or really answer a question. Even if you don't like Hillary at least she attempts to tell you her plans.
1798,1,"Yes! I don't ""like"" Hillary, but I dislike her slightly less each time I watch one of these for the simple fact that she obviously works really hard at doing the work that's required. I would much prefer a more left-leaning candidate, but at least she understands how the different levels of American government work, and is aware of the complexities of international issues. 

I want to hope that in the next 24 hours of sound bites it'll be very clear that Trump didn't answer a bunch of really important questions, and that he's very much out of his league. I want to hope that. But NBC's first comment was about Trump pressing Hillary about Bill, so it might just be another shit show.

That's actually a really good way to put it. Oftentimes I seriously can't understand what he's trying to say - he seems unable to organize his ideas logically. He's like a middle schooler writing an essay, just spitting out whatever comes to mind without any thesis or structure. "

I am a veteran of Afghanistan and do not want the US sending in ground troops to any location that doesn't pose a direct threat to us.

1942,3,"First of all, I think that you are entirely correct. I also am a veteran of Afghanistan and Trump seriously scares me. I posted this elsewhere, but I think that it should be a part of the conversation:

I think that it's important to remember that we are electing the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. For many years(understatement) we have struggled within our military to combat sexual harassment and assault. Even as recently as 2014 our military leaders have [specifically targeted ""what defense officials called 'locker room talk,' because those behaviors show a strong correlation to sexual assault.""](http://thehill.com/policy/defense/195083-military-cracks-down-on-locker-room-talk-at-academies) We need to consider and discuss what the effects of electing a Commander in Chief who makes comments advocating sexual assault, then justifies those remarks as ""locker room talk."" Not only does it tell our soldiers that it's alright to objectify and abuse women, but it justifies the broader scope of ""locker room talk"" which the military is already attempting to curtail. How can you tell a Private in the Army that he can't make sexually aggressive comments when he can go online and see the man at the top of his chain-of-command saying the exact same thing and excusing it as acceptable talk for men-among-men. You can't. The damage is already done and whether he was fit to be President or not, this alone should be enough to consider him unfit."

1965,1,"Yes! I don't ""like"" Hillary, but I dislike her slightly less each time I watch one of these for the simple fact that she obviously works really hard at doing the work that's required. I would much prefer a more left-leaning candidate, but at least she understands how the different levels of American government work, and is aware of the complexities of international issues. 

I want to hope that in the next 24 hours of sound bites it'll be very clear that Trump didn't answer a bunch of really important questions, and that he's very much out of his league. I want to hope that. But NBC's first comment was about Trump pressing Hillary about Bill, so it might just be another shit show. 

*edit: too dumb to spell after having been exposed to Trump for an hour and a half"
1966,3,Welcome to the Westworld
1967,3,"Seriously, has no one read a single history book? If people think this was even remotely a ""bloody debate"" they're incredibly uninformed. "
1968,1,"Yeah, Andrew Jackson would beat Trump over the head with his cane. And then Aaron Burr would shoot him."
1969,1,"Jackson might support the whole ""send the illegals packing"" thing, though. Although in a much more violent fashion than I imagine Donald Trump plans.

1970,3,"""All my words will be cromulent. Perfectly cromulent!"""
1971,4,The word cromulent reminds me of a flaky pastry or baked good like croissant or cronuts.
1972,1,"Everytime Trump spoke to a brown person he started rambling about inner city ghettoes, no matter what the question was"
1973,3,Not entirely true! He also told a Muslim lady that she needs to report it whenever she sees bombs being made in her fellow Muslims' homes.
1974,0,That improvisation is the main thing her debate style is missing. Obama would have jumped on that one.
1975,2,"I thought they were both ok answers in terms of their content, but that Hillary framed her answer poorly. She should have said that she respects Trump because he has done well by his children and they have turned out to be wonderful people or something rather than starting with ""I respect his children""."
1976,3,"She complimented in such a way that it couldn't be cut and used in a commercial, but they couldn't say she didn't compliment."
1977,3,Funny considering how much he's slated her for lacking stamina tbh
1978,3,"Vote for Pence: ""My role model is Dick Cheney"""
1979,3,That..is it all the worst part? Maybe it is all the worst part.

1988,3,Seems to be trying to say that one of his companies was given a contract to do/redo the old post office building in some fashion and that is somehow proof that he pays taxes and has no weird and/or conflicting business concerns. As if they choose a company based solely on their financials ( a weird thing to suggest) and that somehow his personal tax and money issues would be a part of company financial documents. It's a weird nonsensical point. It's so absurd it's more incriminating than saying nothing about it.
1989,3,I love how this comment was unnoticed 3 days ago and now it is a national treasure.

1997,3,"I make comments, I make great comments, I know comments and I find yours amazing.

"
1998,3,"Because when he's pressured to answer specific policy questions, he flounders. Just look at when he was grilled on Aleppo. He fell apart. "
1999,3,"I can't hear him talk anymore. My brain just wants to devour itself trying to untie all the verbal knots he makes when speaking. Even when someone gives him a jumping-off point, he response bears no relevance to what was asked. "
2000,4,"> My brain just wants to devour itself


That's actually a really good way to put it. Oftentimes I seriously can't understand what he's trying to say - he seems unable to organize his ideas logically. He's like a middle schooler writing an essay, just spitting out whatever comes to mind without any thesis or structure. "
2001,4,"When grading, that stuff is just given the lowest grade, writes a vague comment like ""Needs to organize thoughts more clearly"" and the teacher moves on to the next essay. Seriously, I've seen way more coherent essays from students with English as their third language, or students with PTSD. Trump is just all over the place and each fragment of a thought has no relevance to anything else."
2002,3,That's because he is not actually educated on the issues and is skirting around them waiting for the clock to run out.
2003,3,I think the only actual thing he discussed policy wise was getting rid of state borders for health insurers. 
2004,0,"No it was *sniffle* instead of silence, there was no quiet moment in this debate "

2007,1,Trump didn't understand that the sex tape comment was the problem. You know since he's en enormous sexist. 
2008,3,its unbelievable that he managed to get this far
2009,3,"Yes, this election has been.... Exceptional.

You picked an awkward time to join up but... Uh.... Welcome!"
2010,3,Yes it was insane.

2013,2,"It depends upon what you value - if you value information and facts than you think Hillary won. If you value bluster, you believe Trump won"
2014,3,Because he has none....

2025,3,But remember she's been fighting ISIS for her entire adult life.
2026,3,"But then people would have called her a condescending bitch. I think she handled it well enough. People know that as one person in the senate, you can't do it all... right?"
2027,1,You're putting a lot of faith in the 40~% of people voting for Trump.
2028,1,"It's so weird how people forget that.  They wouldn't trust the Kardashians to balance their checkbooks, but think Donald Trump can effectively lead the country.  

I don't really get it.  I understand the desire for something different, but Trump?  Really?"
2029,3,"First of all, I think that you are entirely correct. I also am a veteran of Afghanistan and Trump seriously scares me. I posted this elsewhere, but I think that it should be a part of the conversation:

I think that it's important to remember that we are electing the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. For many years(understatement) we have struggled within our military to combat sexual harassment and assault. Even as recently as 2014 our military leaders have [specifically targeted ""what defense officials called 'locker room talk,' because those behaviors show a strong correlation to sexual assault.""](http://thehill.com/policy/defense/195083-military-cracks-down-on-locker-room-talk-at-academies) We need to consider and discuss what the effects of electing a Commander in Chief who makes comments advocating sexual assault, then justifies those remarks as ""locker room talk."" Not only does it tell our soldiers that it's alright to objectify and abuse women, but it justifies the broader scope of ""locker room talk"" which the military is already attempting to curtail. How can you tell a Private in the Army that he can't make sexually aggressive comments when he can go online and see the man at the top of his chain-of-command saying the exact same thing and excusing it as acceptable talk for men-among-men. You can't. The damage is already done and whether he was fit to be President or not, this alone should be enough to consider him unfit."
2030,3,"An issue that he was asked twice about, after giving a long, rambling non-answer the first time. "
2031,3,"That was the one that got me too.

If I remember correctly, it's what got the biggest laugh out of Clinton too. Who can blame her?"
2032,2,"He said she had hate in her heart. In a Trump op ed he about those 5 teens that were accused of murdering a woman he said something like ""Maybe what America needs is more hate"". "
2033,3,And revealing that it clearly went over his head that she was making fun of him when she sent out that tweet.
2034,3,"And she was tweeting out a policy proposal, not an ad for a sex tape."

2096,1,"Trump's interruptions of Wallace were amazing.

He was pressing Clinton on the appearance of a conflict of interest with her Foundation, and her answer was not the best. But when he want back to press her again Trump came in and started talking about throwing gays off roofs, and Clinton was like ""hell yes Don let's change the topic to something insane."""
2097,4,"Half of me is mad she didn't answer the question, but the other half of me applauded the fact that she was smart enough to recognize Donald's interruption as an easy way to get out of the corner she was in. Like her or not, girl's got mad debate skills."
2098,4,"I'm honestly a little disappointed in all these debates. Clinton's biggest strength as a politician who is a major policy hawk, well read on every issue to an insane level, who usually doesn't give the time of day to anything else. Her main problem is that she doesn't really care about stuff like using private email servers, and she has had to study a lot on how to do the traditional bloviating politician shtick.

If the Republicans had actually nominated a semi-serious candidate, we would probably be having some very sharp and revealing policy discussion where Clinton and this imaginary Republican go toe to toe on where economic growth comes from, how to untangle Syria, and what can be done to improve race relations. We would here about body cameras, carbon caps, and entitlement reform like they were nothing.

Instead, we get this shit. Clinton is one of the smartest people out there and will be a much better President than she is a campaigner. If the GOP thinks they will have an easy time in 2020 they are in for a surprise."
2099,2,"The best part was the reactions of both candidates. Trump honestly looked proud of himself, and Hillary was smiling to herself because the moderator had just subtly called out her opponent."

2105,3,"Wait, for real? 

I'm a filthy rube that actually doesn't know what the highest tax rate was in 1950."
2106,3,"Yeah the highest bracket was super high up until Reagan slashed em. The way tax brackets work is e.g. : every dollar you earn 1-9.99MM is taxed at 35% every dollar after 10MM in that year is taxed at 90%. This is just an example but I wanna stress because lots get this wrong, at no time does making more money and getting taxed more mean that you make less net money."
2107,3,"Australian here, lots of otherwise smart, normal people do not realise this. They complain about being pushed into a ""higher tax bracket"" as if it means they get less money."

2109,2,"Ohhh but what was even better was he continued and said ""it's not as bad as the N word! Right?"" And leaned over to Van for support. Everyone then just let him float with no support on that.  I don't think I've ever laughed that hard in my life."
2110,3,What'd he say?
2111,2,"Jeffrey Lord was defending Trump's use of the term ""bad hombres"" and said he heard that on TV in the 50s all the time."
2112,2,"He defended ""bad hombres"" as an inoffensive saying.  First, he said it's ""not as bad as the N word"".  Then, he followed that by saying that he hears people using it all the time.  When someone asked where he hears it, he cited ""1950s TV shows"". "

2130,2,"The hillaryclinton.com shoutouts bothered me too, they didn't really appeal to an independent audience. Saying to just google it is much, much more effective.

2131,4,"I don't understand how you can run for president and not realize when you have a microphone attached to you people can replay what you said. Like when he denied making fun of the disabled reporter.

But he still denies he did it. Like I can't just YouTube the clip. "

It was remarkable, truly."

2135,2,Correct I noticed that too. Now...who do you want dealing with other world leaders when it comes to representing America? Donald or Hillary

2147,3,"Worst moment of the debate: 

""I'll leave you in suspense"""
2148,2,"I dunno if that beats:

* *I don't trust or believe US intelligence agencies*
* *What a nasty woman*
* *I didn't say that* SMASH CUT to him saying it
* *The Iraqis are attacking Mosul to help Hillary in the polls*
* *Hillary shouldn't be able to vote because I think she committed a crime, and the application of law and order and the constitution is at my whim*

He went full Infowars tonight, and I can count at least two or three attack ads that will just quote him, and he'll claim he never said any of it."
2149,3,[removed]
2150,1,Unprecidented in the history of American politics is Trump's middle name.
2151,3,Junprecedented 
2152,3,The J is silent.
2153,3,Gore probably has the most legitimate case in history to contest a vote and even he bowed out gracefully.
2154,3,"Although I agree that those are terrible, a presidential nominee refusing to state that he will abide by voter choice is literally a nightmare scenario in American politics. "
2155,3,"What the fuck does that even mean? 

I'm not trying to be funny or anything. It's just so incoherent and idiotic.

What does it *mean*?"
2156,3,"In the history of our nation, each losing candidate makes a concession speech. Every. Single. One. The moderator pretty much laid out the grounds, it is accepted as the norm - almost an unwritten rule if you will - and we move on as a nation. 

**Edit:** The moderator, not Clinton, pointed out that it is essentially custom.

Wallace: But sir, there's a tradition in this country of the peaceful transition of power, and no matter how hard fought a campaign is, the loser concedes to the winner - not saying you'll be the loser - and they come together for the good of the country."
2157,1,Trump is very good with unwritten rules........*Tax returns* *cough cough*....uh *sniff*
2158,3,"It means he can't answer yes or no, because if he wins, he'll accept the outcome.  If he loses, he's going to whine like a petulant child and declare it's a rigged outcome and The People shouldn't accept that Clinton won.  

From his POV, it's a trick question.  He can't say, ""I accept the outcome no matter what"" or ""I won't accept the outcome"", because it depends on who wins.  If Clinton wins, then it wasn't a real, legitimate election and the voters didn't really get their voice heard.  If he wins, then it's the will of the people and there's no sense challenging his victory."
2159,0,[deleted]
2160,4,"He's treating a US presidential election like reality TV because he's a narcissistic piece of shit. He doesn't care about the real world consequences, he just wants to tickle his ego. Fuck Republicans for giving this moron the power to have a national stage."
2161,3,Horrifying.
2162,3,"Oh its guaranteed at this point.  Trump does not give a fuck about what it means for a candidate to not concede.  To him its no big deal.  Frankly, he is just too stupid to realize WHY its important for the peaceful transfer of power."
2163,3,Every single inaguration day it's celebrated how beautiful and important this is
2164,3,It actually is. This is literally insurrection against the United States.  Accepting the peaceful transfer of power and election results is the foundation of our government. Take that away and we have nothing but chaos.
2165,3,"Wow, Van Jones isn't taking any prisoners... 

>What we just got here was the nominee for a major party for the first time in our history signalling to the American people that he has so little faith in our institutions, he has so little faith in our people, he has so little faith in our courts, he has so little faith in our Republican Governors.. that he will not stand in front of his own country, in front of his own nation and say that he respects the process and the outcome. That is an outrage, the appalling lack of patriotism from this man, to stand there and praise Putin and Assad more than he has ever praised any American president.

https://twitter.com/CNN/status/788937779451396097"
2166,2,"Honestly Van's best quote of the night was when he was discussing Hombres post debate. The female Hispanic pundant said she found it offensive and why, and the conservative pendants tore into about political correctness being bad.

Van sat there and said something along the lines of: If I tell you something is offensive, and you tell me, it is in the nature of civility that I try to understand how what I said was wrong. It used to be called civility. It wasn't called ""political correctness"" until others(hinting to minorities) started asking for it.

An absolutely perfect and succinct way to sum up the point. "
2167,3,"I can sort of understand the logic of someone saying they have no respect for the election process.   I'm not that good of it myself.   What I don't understand is that person RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.  

""So,  tell us why you want to work here. ""

"" Well,  you're truly awful and I have nothing but disdain for your and your business. """
2168,1,"I'd be one thing if he actually rationally criticized our process.

You know, the lack of a national voting holiday, low voter turnout when compared with western liberal democracies, corporate money in the process (inb4 ""but shillary,"" one candidate took the stage and pledged to appoint justices to overturn citizens united, and it wasn't trump), our failure to educate young Americans on civic responsibility, foreign governments actively attempting to subvert our process (*cough* Russia *cough*), totally inadequate polling stations in urban areas, etc, etc, etc.

But that's not what he does. When he's ahead, the polls are great, the people are great, the process is great. When he's down? Literally everything is rigged ooooo woe is me.

Jesus fuck how can you call yourself a trump supporter and not be embarrassed at this point?"
2169,3,Van Jones has been AMAZING throughout all this. Always love what I hear from him.
2170,3,"I know he’s from Fox News, but damn, I actually think Chris Wallace was a terrific moderator. He wasn’t afraid to interject the candidates when needed or when they didn’t address the question. While he did come across with a conservative bias once or twice, but he certainly stood up against Donald when it was needed. I would love to see him on another network."
2171,3,I couldn't agree more. He was a great moderator. 
2172,4,He killed it. He went after Clinton and Trump equally it felt like 
2173,3,"Not only that, but he went after the audience. He was not putting up with any shit in his house."
2174,3,"""Yeah!!!"" ""Woohoo!!!""

*""HEY SETTLE THE FUCK DOWN""*"
2175,0,I will TURN THIS DEBATE AROUND so help me GOD
2176,3,I was worried he'd be partisan but he seemed to have injected an anti-bullshit aura into the room.
2177,3,Easy to do when he hates both candidates.
2178,3,"Clearly this is the way it should be done, then."
2179,3,"He was even tough on the audience for reacting. 

Chris Wallace just got a new fan. I respect his fairness. "
2180,3,"Agreed, I think he was the best out of the three debates.  He kept it focused, kept the questions coming, and was respectful."
2181,1,"Michelle Obama: ""When they go low, we go high"" 

Trump 2016: ""we can go lower"" "
2182,1,Donald Trump had 60 seconds to let the people of America know why they should be voting him for president. He wasted those 60 seconds on trying to make Hillary look bad one last time. He should have just focused on himself for those last 60 seconds it looked extremely desperate and unprofessional in my opinion.
2183,3,"And capped it with ""She's going to be four more years of that president who's more popular than ever right now."" Not showing the best judgement there."
2184,1,Agreed. She was struggling in some of those later segments but then completely pulled it back together with that final answer. Then Trump took the easy opening and faceplanted to finish it off
2185,1,"Steve Schmidt (R) calls Trump's refusal to accept the election result, under direct question, a ""disqualifying moment"" and calls on Paul Ryan to pull away."
2186,1,If I get a nickel every time Trump has a disqualifying moment.....
2187,3,You would have a small loan of a million dollars
2188,2,"In case you need anymore proof that Hillary knows what she's doing, Hillary turn that Wikileake question around  to make it about Russia/Putin and Trump took the bait."
2189,4,"I bet she's just laughing her ass off like ""I can't believe that worked.."""
2190,2,"I loved that even while he called it out as being a pivot, which it was, he then continued to sound like a Putin evangelical by saying things like ""I haven't even met him! But they're so great! And we're so weak now! I think if we were friends everything would be better! Haven't met him but he's so strong!""

Was just a seriously jaw-droppingly bad performance. I thought maybe he could pick up more of the ignorant vote since he performed slightly better the second time and actually prepared this time, but just every time he talked it was rambling nonsense. Hillary said ""let me try to translate that"" and he would say ""you can't"" and it was true, because it was gibberish. This election has been entertaining as hell but good god is it going to be a landslide."
2191,1,Fox News is surprisingly killing Trump's people on their lies.
2192,0,Megyn Kelly is the winner of this debate holy shit.
2193,1,"Why do you wanna be president? 

Clinton: this this and this. 

Trump: fuck clinton . Nasty woman"
2194,3,"Honestly that's why all of his supporters are voting, so I'd say he hit the nail on the head...just happened to also seal his coffin hopefully. "
2195,2,"Barack Obama's approval rating has recently reached a record high, and Trump just said on national TV that a Hillary Clinton presidency would be four more years of Obama.

Top-notch campaigning. 

Edit: spelling"
2196,4,Its like Ryan invoking Bernie Sanders.
2197,3,"yeah, there's no way that was an accident"
2198,3,"So we could have tacos, a Sanders win, and 4 more years of Obama. We will find Utopia."
2199,3,"Said this in the other thread, but: I didn't know one senator could change everything in government. He really needs to give up that talking point up.

I know what he is getting at, but it just doesn't make sense. Government in this country is based on compromise. Does he not understand that? "
2200,3,"He kept repeating that she could have done something for 30 years, ok let's look at this. 

First Lady of Arkansas 
1983-1992
What can she do?

First Lady of the United States
1993-2001
What can she do?

United States Senator from New York
2001-2009
She worked with fellow members of the United States Senate to make some change but she has no ability to act unilaterally.

United States Secretary of State
2009-2013
Under direct command from Barack Obama but has some major power to enact change on a Geopolitical level.

So she had no real power until she became a U.S. Senator in 2001 which halves Trump's claim. On a global stage she only had real power for four years while being under the command of the POTUS. "
2201,4,"No, he doesn't. When you listen to him speak he thinks he can run the country like he runs a company, but he can't."
2202,3,Yeah I'm really surprised she didn't tell him that Senators can't introduce legislation that increases revenues because those bills must start in the House and the United States isn't a fucking dictatorship 
2203,3,3 debates and not once did somebody get Donald to say **HOW** he was going to do something.
2204,0,[deleted]
2205,3,hes gonna do a lot of deals in the boardroom. negotiate some of the best deals youve ever seen. believe me. the best.
2206,3,They're gonna be tremendous and bring millions and millions of jobs back to America. It's gonna be beautiful. Believe me. 
2207,2,Other than his cuttting taxes lol.  It is the only thing he said about any of his plans.
2208,3,And getting rid of Obamacare because apparently it's the root of all evil to him
2209,3,"I think he just hates the word Obama, he will rename it to Trumpcare.

Who am I kidding, there won't be no care anymore."
2210,2,He said it plenty of times.  Lower taxes.  That's all you gotta do!  The economy just fixes itself when you lower taxes.
2211,3,"I think there are two categories of people right now:

1. People who have realized that it's a pointless question to ask because Trump doesn't have an answer.  
2. People who think it's a pointless question to ask because they don't care about the details but believe him when he says he'll do it.

I have a hard time believing that *anyone* who isn't already decided on voting for him still thinks he might actually be able to explain in detail what he plans to do.  It's shockingly blatant that there really isn't a concrete plan, just talking points."
2212,4,"Just like last debate, Trump showed he has no idea how senate works, when he accused Hillary of not changing the laws on her own as a lone senator just like that."
2213,3,"I keep wondering why she didn't remind him that she was a senator, not a dictator."
2214,3,"> I keep wondering why she didn't remind him that she was a senator, not a dictator.

And she was only senator for 12 years, not 30.   30 years ago Hillary Clinton the First Lady of Arkansas.    She was supposed to have a major impact on the country from that position?  Have any other First Ladies of Arkansas affected our lives in any way?"
2215,3,"Because it has to play in subtext.  Running for president, you can't project powerlessness even if it makes perfect sense.  The expectation is that a person running for president should have been corralling the senate themselves by putting forward, championing, and ensuring a vote for legislation.  To a point that's a totally reasonable expectation: senators can be very influential and we do want the best of the best for the highest office, but even when it isn't reasonable you can't say it.  Even a voter who understands the complexities can have their opinions colored by the implication of weakness."
2216,1,"People understand, specially in the recent years, one person can't just change a law...  it's only Trump that doesn't seem to realize that....

Edit: can to can't 
"
2217,1,Is Trump not getting his third Emmy basically his version of Hitler not getting into art school?
2218,1,"On mobile so I don't have the link, but look up the vid of Obama trashing Trump at the presidential correspondents dinner a few years back. He gets him hard. They show Trump's reaction for a bit and it's just.. this look. That moment right there is like watching a supervillain being born.

It was also, coincidentally, the same night that (not yet known to the crowd/public) the raid on Bin Laden's compound was taking place."
2219,3,This is my favorite post in the thread.  
2220,3,Slow clap.
2221,3,Suspenseful clap. 
2222,3,"Not that it matteres but for anyone keeping notice Clinton wore a blue dress, a red dress, and tonight a white dress to complete her murica trinity. "
2223,3,They were suits but yes. 
2224,3,"I'm not normally into outfit talk, but I love that. Classy af"
2225,0,"Huh, weird I didn't consciously notice that. The way I saw it was that she wore red the first debate to counter any idea of her being weak, she wore blue the second debate to paint her in a more calming and personable light, and she wore white the last debate to symbolize the purity of the office of the POTUS."
2226,4,I need somebody like you in my life to help me decide what to put on in the mornings.
2227,1,"Really thought that Clinton would just ride out the last debate and let Trump bury himself, but she actually went on the offensive and did it surprisingly well. She got the shots in while discussing policy and even added a bit of humor to the mix.

Trump got baited so badly when she did as well. He fell apart 90% of the times she insulted him. His whole debate went off the rails as soon as she said he had choked when he went to meet the president of Mexico.

Edit: Also Clinton looked genuinely disgusted by Trump at various times during the debate, and disgusted to be on the same stage as him. This election has been disturbingly personal at a level I don't remember seeing in any election before."
2228,2,The emails were going to be a talking point if hillary just slid by on this one.  She had to be aggressive to maintain the narrative and keep trump talking about other topics that he would fumble with. 
2229,3,Even Al Gore accepted the results of a highly contested presidential election in which he won far more votes and a court helped decide.
2230,1,MEGYN KELLY IS *SAVAGE* TONIGHT. No fucking brakes on the Kelly train. She is wrecking this poor Trump campaign dude's shit.
2231,0,This one? https://youtu.be/Ox3EAov54Ms
2232,3,I called the police. What she did to him could not have been illegal. She grilled Donna Brazille later as well but she was able to weasel out. This poor guy though...
2233,3,Kellyanne on CNN is having a rough time.
2234,3,Walking away... not a good look
2235,3,she had no choice but to walk away...
2236,3,It would've ended worse for her if she didn't walk away.
2237,3,"She's gotta earn her paycheck, but her employer is making it damn near impossible. "
2238,3,I missed it. What happened?
2239,2,"She was asked ""What happens if he doesn't accept defeat?"" and she just said, ""Oh well he won't lose"" and noped the fuck out."
2240,4,Like walked off? Literally? 
2241,3,Yes.

2246,3,He disrespected a woman tonight! On fucking live TV! That Nasty Woman line was soooo fucking uncalled for. 
2247,3,"Wrong!

Wrong!

Wrong!"
2248,4,Have to give credit to* Van Jones for pointing out that it's sophistry to compare the US growth rate to developing economies like China and India.
2249,1,Lets not forget what I think is the biggest moment.  Trump dismissed the findings of 17 intelligence agencies of the United States in order to defend Putin.  
2250,3,"He could have easily spun that... say ""yes, I'm aware of the intelligence being reported and it's very likely accurate. However I'm in favour of maintaining a good relationship with Russia. I think being civil with Putin would help America bigly""

Instead he essentially discredited some very powerful and well run intelligence organizations."
2251,2,"Any reasonable person could have easily said, ""Of course I believe the experts and condemn Russia's actions. That doesn't change the fact that I want to know about those e-mails."" The only reason not to say it is because he actually is cozy with Putin.  "

Also Trump: ""NAFTA was the worst thing to ever happen to this country"""
2258,3,"I'm confused, is NAFTA the worst deal of all time, or was the Iran nuclear deal the worst deal of all time?"
2259,3,"He calls every trade deal the worst. He's against trade because it has pros and cons. Therefore, in his eyes, it only has cons"
2260,3,"""While I was bringing Osama bin Laden to judgement while you were hosting Celebrity Apprentice""

2263,3,"That actually would be appropriate, considering Pence would've been the one in charge of foreign and domestic affairs."
2264,4,"As a Canadian I've been wondering, if your not in charge of domestic or foreign policy....... is there a third policy I'm missing. Because if I said I wasn't in charge of anything off my property or on it, that would sound like I wasn't in charge. "
2265,3,The third policy is Making America Great Again.
2266,3,I think that's the point.

2268,3,Why do we keep perpetuating this idea that Syrians refugees aren't being vetted??
2269,3,Probably similar reasons why a certain party keeps perpetuating that dead people vote and massive amounts of women yank their aborted babies out 4 days before term.
2270,3,Hats off to Wallace tonight. He did as good of a job as you can  possibly do on trying to control the candidates and call them on previous lies.
2271,3,"I will admit, I went into this thinking that a Fox News anchor couldn't possibly be unbiased. I was pleasantly surprised."
2272,3,"He had way better control, but some of the framing of his questions were weird."
2273,1,"I think his framing was very much from a Conservative/GOP/Fox News sort of angle, which isn't a huge shock considering where he works.

I liked it a bit though, because I thought it cut to a lot of issues that GOP/Conservative voters have with Hillary and Trump, and while it should've helped Trump by being more in his supposed 'sweet spot', it was such an incoherent, rambling mess most the time, it completely eliminated the advantage.  Conversely, it gave Clinton an opportunity to really face the 'tough' questions and hammer home solid answers (though she certainly pivoted from a few questions I think we all would've liked some more direct answers to).

In total, I think the debate was a microcosm of what (some of) Fox News and mainstream conservatives feel about Trump and the election - they don't like Clinton, but they know Trump is an asshat and a terrible choice.  I thought Wallace did a service by giving questions that allowed Clinton to really speak directly to the fears of moderate conservatives, and really make her case as being a perfectly acceptable and reasonable candidate for President - not this crazy boogie man that the alt-right and hardliners have...trumped...her up to be. "
2274,3,"To me, the defining moment came early:   

(Paraphrase) Clinton: I want the constitution to work for all people. Marriage equality, freedom of choice, take govt. out of women's health.    

Trump: I want the constitution to work as the founders wrote it. (which was in 1787. Slavery, women as second-class citizens, only white male land owners could vote.)    "
2275,1,"> Slavery, women as second-class citizens, only white male land owners could vote.

Yes, that would suit Trump perfectly."

2286,3,"This is just to add to the rhetoric used this evening in regards to women's health and Roe V. Wade, while I may not like either candidate there was some jargon and wording used to incite fear, ""to rip a child out of a woman"", this wording has made my physically ill. 
[Engaging Slight Rant]
This decision to terminate in my pregnancy later in process (due to t13) was not easy it down right sucked and it to this day, years later, kills me. 
I'll never get over it. 
Tonight I had to listen to someone talk about how I made my decision, how I had been cavalier about what I literally had to do due to the fact that quality of life for my daughter was basically null. 
To think I may have to live in a society where I would have to carry to full term knowing full well what was ahead of me, and not being able to humanly take care of myself and my child makes me question the ""greatness"" that our country is trying to strive to. "
2287,3,I am sorry you had to go through that. Fuck this election. 
2288,3,"Thank you, this election is making horrible generalizations of major issues. It is sickening. "

2291,1,"""I won't commit to it, I'll keep you in suspense""

There's no longer any wiggle room or way to say that people are just blowing things out of proportion. Donald Trump is actually an (albeit minor) threat to American democracy"
2292,1,"Trump's word choice during the pro-choice part was disgusting. 

""Rip the baby out"". 

It was scare rhetoric that neglected the sensitivities required of such a situation as late-term abortion. It showed an insensitivity to those women who would be placed in that position and how it is a very difficult situation. He just cannot empathize. Disgusting.  "
2293,3,"The only person I knew that had a late term abortion (six months) did it because she found the  very wanted fetus had total anencephaly...and she couldn't bear the thought of having to deliver that baby and watch it suffer and die slowly.

Women don't do them for funsies. Jesus."
2294,3,Same. It was heartbreaking. They'd been trying for years.
2295,4,"Exactly. Also he acts like every woman who has a late term abortion wants to carry to full term, go through all the sickness and hardships on their body for as long as possible then get an abortion for the sake of it. He has no clue what he's talking about."
2296,3,"Fuck him fuck him fuck him. A very good friend of mine had a late-term abortion because the babies neck had a hole in it, there were deformities with the head, and a whole host of issues. They told her if she carried to term and the baby survived, it would be suffering until it inevitably died. There was no way it would live beyond a few months, and they would have it in the hospital the entire time forcing the poor child to live. She chose not to hurt her baby that way. So I pray she was not watching this because fuck him for hurting people who have to go through that suffering with his words."
2297,1,"and... honestly.

does anyone believe that trump hasn't paid for 1400 abortions over the years?  it's so disingenous i want to scream."
2298,3,"That debate was a slaughter. Might have solidified his share of 35%, but honestly he was humiliated on almost every god damn issue. Then he called her a nasty woman and refused to concede. He was eviscerated and wrote the bylines. Coverage is going to harp on that for days."

2307,4,"I think it's pretty clear that in the seconds immediately following that statement, he made eye contact with either Kellyanne Conway or Melania and they were like ಠ_ಠ"
2308,1,"I agree with Hillary - I am appalled that Trump refuses to say whether he will accept the outcome of the election.

If he wants to complain about biased media coverage, fine. If he wants to call attention to flaws in our voting system, fair play. But to recklessly question the core mechanism of our democracy, the only reason any of us believe it works, is irresponsible. It's irresponsible because it could inspire some very stupid, very impressionable, very dangerous people to feel as if their nation has been compromised and that they need to take action. We've already seen what those sick bastards in Kansas were planning; what's going to happen if their Dear Leader tells them that the election is illegitimate and the president elect has assumed power under false pretenses?

I've been shitposting along with most of r/politics in an effort to find some humor in this shitshow of an election, but this time I feel compelled to be completely serious. Shame on you, Donald Trump. We can now definitively confirm that there is truly no depths to which you won't descend. And all because your damaged ego can't bring itself to believe those polls that you wouldn't shut the fuck up about a few months ago."

Wow. That is without a shred of a doubt the most insane answer in American political history.

Edit: Our democracy is under assault. "
2318,3,"> I'll keep you in suspense!

Trump is treating this whole election as a reality show. He fucking doesn't care what happens to the people, the country, the families, the economy. He ONLY and ONLY cares about himself. He just doesn't fucking give a damn about anything! He'll burn the whole country down just to be President!"
2319,1,So according to Trump - did Obama help latin americans/hispanics by providing amnesty or did he hurt them by deporting millions of them?
2320,3,"Four general election debates and not one single question on climate change. No matter what side you're on, that should disturb you. The government is already spending millions relocating Alaskan families due to rising oceans and coal pollution is killing thousands every year. Whether or not you disagree with scientific consensus, the fact that such a humanity-defining question was never asked is disgusting.
"
2321,2,"At least Hillary mentioned Green energy, but that's about all we got."
2322,1,I think she also attacked Trump in the second debate for being a climate denier.   
2323,2,"If you want something promising on that front, Hillary's leaked Wall Street speeches mentioned climate change a lot."

2332,0,"Yea, if you genuinely care about climate change there's no debate. Vote Clinton."
2333,1,"Key take away points from the debate. 

Trump refused to take a stance on peaceful democratic transition. By far the most disqualifying thing he's ever done. 

Trump did nothing to help himself with women voters, if anything I think most women would be even more disgusted if that's possible. "
2334,3,"Props to Chris Wallace, this was by far the best debate out of the 3. The other 2 were absolute shit shows compared to this one. Not one question on climate change was very saddening. "

2340,3,"Hillary won this.  No question about it.  Her answers were substantive and had some thought behind them even if you disagreed with them.

Meanwhile, Trump came out looking well and then melted down.  He tried his ""no one respects women more than me"" and the audience laughed at him.  Then he followed up with ""such a nasty woman"" comment that just shot himself in the head with that. "
2341,2,"My cousin (Trump supporter) made a FB status that said:

""Rovey Wade? Jeez, it's Roe vs. Wade.""

He was trying to accuse Hillary of not saying the court case correctly.. except she was saying ""Roe v. Wade"", which is perfectly acceptable.

That's what Trump supporters have left."
2342,3,"I don't think I have ever heard ""Roe versus Wade.""  It's always just Vee.

2343,3,"Law student here: lawyers never pronounce ""versus."" It's always just ""vee."""
2344,4,"It's easier that way, and seeing how Hillary has a law degree, it makes sense she'd say it.

It's just exasperating to see arguments like this from my own family."
2345,3,"I can't believe Trump felt the need to say ""Such a nasty woman"" while she was talking. Biggest mistake of the debate in my opinion."
2346,3,The bar is set so low I'm actually positively surprised he didn't call her a bitch.
2347,3,"I mean, he called her a bitch in his head. ""Nasty woman"" is what we got when his emergency filter kicked in. "
2348,3,He must have had that put in just before coming out on stage.
2349,3,"I agree that was a blunder, but the biggest mistake IMO was doubling down on not necessarily accepting the results if the election. "
2350,3,"There was a *lot* of mistakes in there. That one made me dislike him, but the thing about accepting the election results? That's fucking terrifying. He's advocating another civil war."

2375,1,"Chris Wallace was the high point of this debate in my eyes. I think Trump and Clinton only got out of hand twice, and that wasn't exactly Wallace's fault. Props to him. 

Also, Trump's closing statement was more about Clinton than it was about him, bit of a mistake."
2376,1,">The audience will shut the fuck up. Trump and Clinton are to shut the fuck up because we are going to the next question. If anyone's got a fucking problem with that, shove it up your ass.

Chris ""I will turn this debate around, so help me"" Wallace."
2377,1,"Trump: Can I finish?
Wallace: Well, no."
2378,1,"Yes.  Clinton deliberately avoided taking about Trump in her closing, and it made her look much better."
2379,3,"**Hillary Clinton Supreme Court Priorities:**

* Stand up to Citizens United.
* Stand for the LGBT community. Not reverse Marriage Equality
* Not reverse Roe v. Wade
* ""Standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans.""
* Confirm the nominee that Obama presented. 

**Donald Supreme Court Priorities:**

* ""Justice Ginsburg made some very inappropriate statements towards me and she was forced to apologize, and apologize she did.""
* Uphold the 2nd amendment that is under ""absolute siege."" ""Under such trauma.""
* Pro-life, conservative bent.
* ""If the Supreme Court overturns it, [Roe v. Wade] they will go back to the states.""
* People of tremendous respect.
* Interpret the constitution the way the founding fathers wanted it interpreted. ""The way it was meant to be."""
2380,3,"What rubbed me the wrong way is that he was framing it as ""I'll nominate people who are pro-gun and pro-life"" instead of saying that he would favor judicial nominations that would be strict Constitutionalists. It implies that he would prefer the court to be political, when that's the last thing it should be. Antonio Scalia was always accused of being Conservative, but he stuck by his judicial theory of strict interpretation, not by party lines alone."
2381,3,I don't understand people who want the constitution to never change and be interpreted strictly to the text. It's not gospel and the founding fathers weren't prophets.
2382,1,He literally admitted that he would rig the supreme court to agree with him and do what he wants. Trump has consistently demonstrated an incredible misunderstanding of the US' countermeasures and balances. This and his repeated adamance that Clinton should have been able to change everything singlehandedly

2428,4,"Him not accepting the result of the election is honestly fucking terrifying. Like, violence inducing to some of his supporters."
2429,1,"To me the closing statement section really summed up the election. Whether she means to act on her promises or not, Hillary really acted like a leader and gave a message of inclusion and unity. Trump started his statement with an attack, then continued to fear monger and advocate more division in our society. As an undecided voter, I think this debate settled my indecision.

Also shoutout to Chris Wallace. Very professional moderator who was able to keep reasonable control over the debate and who tried his best to focus on real campaign issues. 

*Edit: I should clarify that I was undecided in the sense that I hadn't made my final decision until tonight. I've leaned away from Trump for a while now, but I tried to keep an open mind, especially because there are issues I don't agree with Hillary on. I decided to wait it out and pass my final judgement once the debates were over."

He has consistently shown that he will not take responsibility for any of his statements, even when they have the potential to incite violence--in regards to his cries of voter fraud.

His rhetoric is dangerous. Words have power, and as much as people hate the it, Donald Trump has significant support amongst a good percentage of voters. This incendiary rhetoric cannot be tolerated as it undermines the foundations of our democracy.

All I can say is that I hope the American people saw the enormous disparities between the two candidates tonight. Just as in the two previous presidential debates beforehand, it is clear that these two candidates have not only two very different ideas of American progress, but two very different realities.

While Hillary Clinton has had trouble with her public image and appearing transparent, she is undoubtedly the only candidate with policy positions founded upon empirical research, and that is fit to lead this nation.

His worst moment? ""Will you accept the results of the election?"" ""I will look at it at the time."" You're a candidate for one of the major parties for the Presidency of the United States. You say ""Yes"". No matter what your true feelings are, *you say ""Yes""*.

Not sure she really had any bad/poor moments.

Congrats, Madam President-Elect."
2482,3,"Trump really outdid himself of this one... instant classic

>TRUMP: But I'd like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I'm -- not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries. Saudi Arabia, nothing but money. We protect Saudi Arabia. Why aren't they paying?   She immediately -- when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO. Why aren't the NATO questioned -- why aren't they paying? Because they weren't paying. Since I did this -- this was a year ago -- all of a sudden, they're paying. And I've been given a lot -- a lot of credit for it. All of a sudden, they're starting to pay up. They have to pay up. We're protecting people, they have to pay up. And I'm a big fan of NATO. But they have to pay up. She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great. Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.  We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out. We have, during his regime, during President Obama's regime, we've doubled our national debt. We're up to $20 trillion.

>So my plan -- we're going to renegotiate trade deals. We're going to have a lot of free trade. We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now. But we have horrible deals. Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever. Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy. You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them. You go upstate New York. Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places. We're bringing our jobs back. I am going to renegotiate NAFTA. And if I can't make a great deal -- then we're going to terminate NAFTA and we're going to create new deals. We're going to have trade, but we're going -- we're going to terminate it, we're going to make a great trade deal. And if we can't, we're going to do it -- we're going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster. We are going to cut taxes massively. We're going to cut business taxes massively. They're going to start hiring people. We're going to bring the $2.5 trillion ...that's offshore back into the country. We are going to start the engine rolling again, because... right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP.

At worst she will do nothing, but for Trump, at worst he will damage this country.

I really hope the polls are right, because wow.... The fact he has ~40% support among potential voters simply blows my mind.

EDIT: For Trump supporters who are simply fed up with establishment politics, I hear you and agree with many of your grievances with Clinton, but during this election the chance for that kind of change died with Sanders' defeat.

He was pressing Clinton on the appearance of a conflict of interest with her Foundation, and her answer was not the best.

2591,4,"Half of me is mad she didn't answer the question, but the other half of me applauded the fact that she was smart enough to recognize Donald's interruption as an easy way to get out of the corner she was in. Like her or not, girl's got mad debate skills."
2592,4,"I'm honestly a little disappointed in all these debates. Clinton's biggest strength as a politician who is a major policy hawk, well read on every issue to an insane level, who usually doesn't give the time of day to anything else. Her main problem is that she doesn't really care about stuff like using private email servers, and she has had to study a lot on how to do the traditional bloviating politician shtick.

If the Republicans had actually nominated a semi-serious candidate, we would probably be having some very sharp and revealing policy discussion where Clinton and this imaginary Republican go toe to toe on where economic growth comes from, how to untangle Syria, and what can be done to improve race relations. We would here about body cameras, carbon caps, and entitlement reform like they were nothing.

Instead, we get this shit. Clinton is one of the smartest people out there and will be a much better President than she is a campaigner. If the GOP thinks they will have an easy time in 2020 they are in for a surprise."

I'm a filthy rube that actually doesn't know what the highest tax rate was in 1950."
2599,3,"Yeah the highest bracket was super high up until Reagan slashed em. The way tax brackets work is e.g. : every dollar you earn 1-9.99MM is taxed at 35% every dollar after 10MM in that year is taxed at 90%. This is just an example but I wanna stress because lots get this wrong, at no time does making more money and getting taxed more mean that you make less net money."
2600,3,"Australian here, lots of otherwise smart, normal people do not realise this. They complain about being pushed into a ""higher tax bracket"" as if it means they get less money."

2603,3,What'd he say?
2604,2,"Jeffrey Lord was defending Trump's use of the term ""bad hombres"" and said he heard that on TV in the 50s all the time."
2605,2,"He defended ""bad hombres"" as an inoffensive saying.  First, he said it's ""not as bad as the N word"".  Then, he followed that by saying that he hears people using it all the time.  When someone asked where he hears it, he cited ""1950s TV shows"". "

It's 2016. You can't lie publicly and get away with it forever, because as soon as you see the video, you know he's a bullshitter."
2616,4,She cut the super-obvious canned jokes/lines too. It's almost like she's running a normal campaign where the staffers pay attention and point out the stuff that doesn't work and the candidate actually listens to them. 
2617,3,"My god, so glad she got rid of the Trumped up trickle down bullshit.  "
2618,2,"The hillaryclinton.com shoutouts bothered me too, they didn't really appeal to an independent audience. Saying to just google it is much, much more effective.

If Hillary were half as nefarious as people love to suggest, she'd have SEO people working on the Trump results. With as tight a campaign she's been running, I wouldn't be surprised."
2619,4,"I don't understand how you can run for president and not realize when you have a microphone attached to you people can replay what you said. Like when he denied making fun of the disabled reporter. 

His surrogates tried to play it off that it was OK he did it because he also made fun of other people. 

But he still denies he did it. Like I can't just YouTube the clip. "
2620,3,"Agreed, he always rose to the bait. And thus spectacularly lost. "
2621,2,Correct I noticed that too. Now...who do you want dealing with other world leaders when it comes to representing America? Donald or Hillary
2622,4,Its like hillary had a previous job or two where she talked with world leaders all the time...
2623,3,"Good point. I personally think she is playing to his weaknesses. I feel if she was up against a real politician it would be a lot more contentious though I think she would have an answer (or deflection).

2624,4,"Oh no, she was playing him like a fiddle. While I would have appreciated it if she had stood her ground more on a few things (what the hell is so awful about NAFTA specifically?) I feel like she effectively showed how much of a reactive punk Trump is."

From his POV, it's a trick question.  He can't say, ""I accept the outcome no matter what"" or ""I won't accept the outcome"", because it depends on who wins.  If Clinton wins, then it wasn't a real, legitimate election and the voters didn't really get their voice heard.  If he wins, then it's the will of the people and there's no sense challenging his victory."

2644,4,"He's treating a US presidential election like reality TV because he's a narcissistic piece of shit. He doesn't care about the real world consequences, he just wants to tickle his ego. Fuck Republicans for giving this moron the power to have a national stage."
2645,3,Horrifying.
2646,3,"Oh its guaranteed at this point.  Trump does not give a fuck about what it means for a candidate to not concede.  To him its no big deal.  Frankly, he is just too stupid to realize WHY its important for the peaceful transfer of power."
2647,3,Every single inaguration day it's celebrated how beautiful and important this is
2648,3,It actually is. This is literally insurrection against the United States.  Accepting the peaceful transfer of power and election results is the foundation of our government. Take that away and we have nothing but chaos.
2649,2,"Honestly Van's best quote of the night was when he was discussing Hombres post debate. The female Hispanic pundant said she found it offensive and why, and the conservative pendants tore into about political correctness being bad.

Van sat there and said something along the lines of: If I tell you something is offensive, and you tell me, it is in the nature of civility that I try to understand how what I said was wrong. It used to be called civility. It wasn't called ""political correctness"" until others(hinting to minorities) started asking for it.

An absolutely perfect and succinct way to sum up the point. "
2650,3,"I can sort of understand the logic of someone saying they have no respect for the election process.   I'm not that good of it myself.   What I don't understand is that person RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.  

""So,  tell us why you want to work here. ""

"" Well,  you're truly awful and I have nothing but disdain for your and your business. """
2651,1,"I'd be one thing if he actually rationally criticized our process.

You know, the lack of a national voting holiday, low voter turnout when compared with western liberal democracies, corporate money in the process (inb4 ""but shillary,"" one candidate took the stage and pledged to appoint justices to overturn citizens united, and it wasn't trump), our failure to educate young Americans on civic responsibility, foreign governments actively attempting to subvert our process (*cough* Russia *cough*), totally inadequate polling stations in urban areas, etc, etc, etc.

But that's not what he does. When he's ahead, the polls are great, the people are great, the process is great. When he's down? Literally everything is rigged ooooo woe is me.

Jesus fuck how can you call yourself a trump supporter and not be embarrassed at this point?"
2652,3,Van Jones has been AMAZING throughout all this. Always love what I hear from him.
2653,3,I couldn't agree more. He was a great moderator. 
2654,4,He killed it. He went after Clinton and Trump equally it felt like 
2655,3,"Not only that, but he went after the audience. He was not putting up with any shit in his house."
2656,3,"""Yeah!!!"" ""Woohoo!!!""

*""HEY SETTLE THE FUCK DOWN""*"
2657,0,I will TURN THIS DEBATE AROUND so help me GOD
2658,3,I was worried he'd be partisan but he seemed to have injected an anti-bullshit aura into the room.
2659,3,Easy to do when he hates both candidates.
2660,3,"Clearly this is the way it should be done, then."
2661,3,"He was even tough on the audience for reacting. 

Chris Wallace just got a new fan. I respect his fairness. "
2662,3,"Agreed, I think he was the best out of the three debates.  He kept it focused, kept the questions coming, and was respectful."
2663,3,"And capped it with ""She's going to be four more years of that president who's more popular than ever right now."" Not showing the best judgement there."
2664,1,Agreed. She was struggling in some of those later segments but then completely pulled it back together with that final answer. Then Trump took the easy opening and faceplanted to finish it off
2665,1,If I get a nickel every time Trump has a disqualifying moment.....
2666,3,You would have a small loan of a million dollars
2667,4,"I bet she's just laughing her ass off like ""I can't believe that worked.."""
2668,2,"I loved that even while he called it out as being a pivot, which it was, he then continued to sound like a Putin evangelical by saying things like ""I haven't even met him! But they're so great! And we're so weak now! I think if we were friends everything would be better! Haven't met him but he's so strong!""

Was just a seriously jaw-droppingly bad performance. I thought maybe he could pick up more of the ignorant vote since he performed slightly better the second time and actually prepared this time, but just every time he talked it was rambling nonsense. Hillary said ""let me try to translate that"" and he would say ""you can't"" and it was true, because it was gibberish. This election has been entertaining as hell but good god is it going to be a landslide."
2669,0,Megyn Kelly is the winner of this debate holy shit.
2670,3,"Honestly that's why all of his supporters are voting, so I'd say he hit the nail on the head...just happened to also seal his coffin hopefully. "
2671,4,Its like Ryan invoking Bernie Sanders.
2672,3,"yeah, there's no way that was an accident"
2673,3,"So we could have tacos, a Sanders win, and 4 more years of Obama. We will find Utopia."
2674,3,"He kept repeating that she could have done something for 30 years, ok let's look at this. 

First Lady of Arkansas 
1983-1992
What can she do?

First Lady of the United States
1993-2001
What can she do?

United States Senator from New York
2001-2009
She worked with fellow members of the United States Senate to make some change but she has no ability to act unilaterally.

United States Secretary of State
2009-2013
Under direct command from Barack Obama but has some major power to enact change on a Geopolitical level.

So she had no real power until she became a U.S. Senator in 2001 which halves Trump's claim. On a global stage she only had real power for four years while being under the command of the POTUS. "
2675,4,"No, he doesn't. When you listen to him speak he thinks he can run the country like he runs a company, but he can't."
2676,3,Yeah I'm really surprised she didn't tell him that Senators can't introduce legislation that increases revenues because those bills must start in the House and the United States isn't a fucking dictatorship

2678,3,hes gonna do a lot of deals in the boardroom. negotiate some of the best deals youve ever seen. believe me. the best.
2679,3,They're gonna be tremendous and bring millions and millions of jobs back to America. It's gonna be beautiful. Believe me. 
2680,2,Other than his cuttting taxes lol.  It is the only thing he said about any of his plans.
2681,3,And getting rid of Obamacare because apparently it's the root of all evil to him
2682,3,"I think he just hates the word Obama, he will rename it to Trumpcare.

Who am I kidding, there won't be no care anymore."
2683,2,He said it plenty of times.  Lower taxes.  That's all you gotta do!  The economy just fixes itself when you lower taxes.
2684,3,"I think there are two categories of people right now:

1. People who have realized that it's a pointless question to ask because Trump doesn't have an answer.  
2. People who think it's a pointless question to ask because they don't care about the details but believe him when he says he'll do it.

I have a hard time believing that *anyone* who isn't already decided on voting for him still thinks he might actually be able to explain in detail what he plans to do.  It's shockingly blatant that there really isn't a concrete plan, just talking points."
2685,3,"I keep wondering why she didn't remind him that she was a senator, not a dictator."
2686,3,"> I keep wondering why she didn't remind him that she was a senator, not a dictator.

And she was only senator for 12 years, not 30.   30 years ago Hillary Clinton the First Lady of Arkansas.    She was supposed to have a major impact on the country from that position?  Have any other First Ladies of Arkansas affected our lives in any way?"
2687,3,"Because it has to play in subtext.  Running for president, you can't project powerlessness even if it makes perfect sense.  The expectation is that a person running for president should have been corralling the senate themselves by putting forward, championing, and ensuring a vote for legislation.  To a point that's a totally reasonable expectation: senators can be very influential and we do want the best of the best for the highest office, but even when it isn't reasonable you can't say it.  Even a voter who understands the complexities can have their opinions colored by the implication of weakness."
2688,1,"People understand, specially in the recent years, one person can't just change a law...  it's only Trump that doesn't seem to realize that....

Edit: can to can't 
"
2689,1,"On mobile so I don't have the link, but look up the vid of Obama trashing Trump at the presidential correspondents dinner a few years back. He gets him hard. They show Trump's reaction for a bit and it's just.. this look. That moment right there is like watching a supervillain being born.

It was also, coincidentally, the same night that (not yet known to the crowd/public) the raid on Bin Laden's compound was taking place."

The way I saw it was that she wore red the first debate to counter any idea of her being weak, she wore blue the second debate to paint her in a more calming and personable light, and she wore white the last debate to symbolize the purity of the office of the POTUS."
2696,4,I need somebody like you in my life to help me decide what to put on in the mornings.
2697,2,The emails were going to be a talking point if hillary just slid by on this one.  She had to be aggressive to maintain the narrative and keep trump talking about other topics that he would fumble with.

2711,3,He disrespected a woman tonight! On fucking live TV! That Nasty Woman line was soooo fucking uncalled for. 
2712,3,"Wrong!

Wrong!

Wrong!"
2713,3,"He could have easily spun that... say ""yes, I'm aware of the intelligence being reported and it's very likely accurate. However I'm in favour of maintaining a good relationship with Russia. I think being civil with Putin would help America bigly""

Instead he essentially discredited some very powerful and well run intelligence organizations."
2714,2,"Any reasonable person could have easily said, ""Of course I believe the experts and condemn Russia's actions. That doesn't change the fact that I want to know about those e-mails."" The only reason not to say it is because he actually is cozy with Putin.  "
2715,3,That's fucking horrifying and not a laughing matter.  
2716,3,I actually consider it a threat. What the fuck man.

2723,4,"As a Canadian I've been wondering, if your not in charge of domestic or foreign policy....... is there a third policy I'm missing. Because if I said I wasn't in charge of anything off my property or on it, that would sound like I wasn't in charge. "
2724,3,The third policy is Making America Great Again.
2725,3,I think that's the point.

"
2727,3,Probably similar reasons why a certain party keeps perpetuating that dead people vote and massive amounts of women yank their aborted babies out 4 days before term.
2728,3,"I will admit, I went into this thinking that a Fox News anchor couldn't possibly be unbiased. I was pleasantly surprised."
2729,3,"He had way better control, but some of the framing of his questions were weird."
2730,1,"I think his framing was very much from a Conservative/GOP/Fox News sort of angle, which isn't a huge shock considering where he works.

I liked it a bit though, because I thought it cut to a lot of issues that GOP/Conservative voters have with Hillary and Trump, and while it should've helped Trump by being more in his supposed 'sweet spot', it was such an incoherent, rambling mess most the time, it completely eliminated the advantage.  Conversely, it gave Clinton an opportunity to really face the 'tough' questions and hammer home solid answers (though she certainly pivoted from a few questions I think we all would've liked some more direct answers to).

In total, I think the debate was a microcosm of what (some of) Fox News and mainstream conservatives feel about Trump and the election - they don't like Clinton, but they know Trump is an asshat and a terrible choice.  I thought Wallace did a service by giving questions that allowed Clinton to really speak directly to the fears of moderate conservatives, and really make her case as being a perfectly acceptable and reasonable candidate for President - not this crazy boogie man that the alt-right and hardliners have...trumped...her up to be. "
2731,1,"> Slavery, women as second-class citizens, only white male land owners could vote.

Yes, that would suit Trump perfectly."

2742,3,"The only person I knew that had a late term abortion (six months) did it because she found the  very wanted fetus had total anencephaly...and she couldn't bear the thought of having to deliver that baby and watch it suffer and die slowly.

Women don't do them for funsies. Jesus."
2743,3,Same. It was heartbreaking. They'd been trying for years.
2744,4,"Exactly. Also he acts like every woman who has a late term abortion wants to carry to full term, go through all the sickness and hardships on their body for as long as possible then get an abortion for the sake of it. He has no clue what he's talking about."
2745,3,"Fuck him fuck him fuck him. A very good friend of mine had a late-term abortion because the babies neck had a hole in it, there were deformities with the head, and a whole host of issues. They told her if she carried to term and the baby survived, it would be suffering until it inevitably died. There was no way it would live beyond a few months, and they would have it in the hospital the entire time forcing the poor child to live. She chose not to hurt her baby that way. So I pray she was not watching this because fuck him for hurting people who have to go through that suffering with his words."
2746,1,"and... honestly.

does anyone believe that trump hasn't paid for 1400 abortions over the years?  it's so disingenous i want to scream."

2756,2,"At least Hillary mentioned Green energy, but that's about all we got."
2757,1,I think she also attacked Trump in the second debate for being a climate denier.   
2758,2,"If you want something promising on that front, Hillary's leaked Wall Street speeches mentioned climate change a lot."
2759,3,"The only climate change related question in any of the three presidential debates was asked by Ken Bone, and the media cycle decided to focus on his red sweater, and that he likes jerking off to preggo porn.

2787,1,"Yes.  Clinton deliberately avoided taking about Trump in her closing, and it made her look much better."
2788,3,"What rubbed me the wrong way is that he was framing it as ""I'll nominate people who are pro-gun and pro-life"" instead of saying that he would favor judicial nominations that would be strict Constitutionalists. It implies that he would prefer the court to be political, when that's the last thing it should be. Antonio Scalia was always accused of being Conservative, but he stuck by his judicial theory of strict interpretation, not by party lines alone."
2789,3,I don't understand people who want the constitution to never change and be interpreted strictly to the text. It's not gospel and the founding fathers weren't prophets.
2790,1,He literally admitted that he would rig the supreme court to agree with him and do what he wants. Trump has consistently demonstrated an incredible misunderstanding of the US' countermeasures and balances. This and his repeated adamance that Clinton should have been able to change everything singlehandedly

2836,4,"Chris Wallace: I know you didn't prepare a closing statement...

Hillary: bitch I could recite to you 15 different closing statements right now. You could wake me from a drunken stupor and I could still give you like 9. "
2837,3,I used to recite closing statements instead of bedtime stories to Chelsea.

2850,3,"The SNL skit about her really humanized her for me. It's a tough job, but someone's gotta do it."
2851,4,"Half of me is mad she didn't answer the question, but the other half of me applauded the fact that she was smart enough to recognize Donald's interruption as an easy way to get out of the corner she was in. Like her or not, girl's got mad debate skills."
2852,4,"I'm honestly a little disappointed in all these debates. Clinton's biggest strength as a politician who is a major policy hawk, well read on every issue to an insane level, who usually doesn't give the time of day to anything else. Her main problem is that she doesn't really care about stuff like using private email servers, and she has had to study a lot on how to do the traditional bloviating politician shtick.

If the Republicans had actually nominated a semi-serious candidate, we would probably be having some very sharp and revealing policy discussion where Clinton and this imaginary Republican go toe to toe on where economic growth comes from, how to untangle Syria, and what can be done to improve race relations. We would here about body cameras, carbon caps, and entitlement reform like they were nothing.

Instead, we get this shit. Clinton is one of the smartest people out there and will be a much better President than she is a campaigner. If the GOP thinks they will have an easy time in 2020 they are in for a surprise."

I'm a filthy rube that actually doesn't know what the highest tax rate was in 1950."
2856,3,"Yeah the highest bracket was super high up until Reagan slashed em. The way tax brackets work is e.g. : every dollar you earn 1-9.99MM is taxed at 35% every dollar after 10MM in that year is taxed at 90%. This is just an example but I wanna stress because lots get this wrong, at no time does making more money and getting taxed more mean that you make less net money."

2858,2,"Jeffrey Lord was defending Trump's use of the term ""bad hombres"" and said he heard that on TV in the 50s all the time."
2859,2,"He defended ""bad hombres"" as an inoffensive saying.  First, he said it's ""not as bad as the N word"".  Then, he followed that by saying that he hears people using it all the time.  When someone asked where he hears it, he cited ""1950s TV shows"". "

2863,3,"My god, so glad she got rid of the Trumped up trickle down bullshit.  "
2864,2,"The hillaryclinton.com shoutouts bothered me too, they didn't really appeal to an independent audience. Saying to just google it is much, much more effective.

If Hillary were half as nefarious as people love to suggest, she'd have SEO people working on the Trump results. With as tight a campaign she's been running, I wouldn't be surprised."
2865,4,"I don't understand how you can run for president and not realize when you have a microphone attached to you people can replay what you said. Like when he denied making fun of the disabled reporter. 

His surrogates tried to play it off that it was OK he did it because he also made fun of other people. 

But he still denies he did it. Like I can't just YouTube the clip. "
2866,4,Its like hillary had a previous job or two where she talked with world leaders all the time...
2867,4,"Oh no, she was playing him like a fiddle. While I would have appreciated it if she had stood her ground more on a few things (what the hell is so awful about NAFTA specifically?) I feel like she effectively showed how much of a reactive punk Trump is."
2868,1,"*The disputed succession of Hillary I has caused Reactionary rebels to rise up! They are led by Donald Trump, who styles himself The Donald, and they will stop at nothing to achieve their goals.*"

2876,3,"In the history of our nation, each losing candidate makes a concession speech. Every. Single. One. The moderator pretty much laid out the grounds, it is accepted as the norm - almost an unwritten rule if you will - and we move on as a nation. 

**Edit:** The moderator, not Clinton, pointed out that it is essentially custom.

Wallace: But sir, there's a tradition in this country of the peaceful transition of power, and no matter how hard fought a campaign is, the loser concedes to the winner - not saying you'll be the loser - and they come together for the good of the country."
2877,1,Trump is very good with unwritten rules........*Tax returns* *cough cough*....uh *sniff*
2878,3,"It means he can't answer yes or no, because if he wins, he'll accept the outcome.  If he loses, he's going to whine like a petulant child and declare it's a rigged outcome and The People shouldn't accept that Clinton won.  

From his POV, it's a trick question.  He can't say, ""I accept the outcome no matter what"" or ""I won't accept the outcome"", because it depends on who wins.  If Clinton wins, then it wasn't a real, legitimate election and the voters didn't really get their voice heard.  If he wins, then it's the will of the people and there's no sense challenging his victory."

2881,3,"Oh its guaranteed at this point.  Trump does not give a fuck about what it means for a candidate to not concede.  To him its no big deal.  Frankly, he is just too stupid to realize WHY its important for the peaceful transfer of power."
2882,3,Every single inaguration day it's celebrated how beautiful and important this is
2883,3,It actually is. This is literally insurrection against the United States.  Accepting the peaceful transfer of power and election results is the foundation of our government. Take that away and we have nothing but chaos.
2884,1,"I'd be one thing if he actually rationally criticized our process.

You know, the lack of a national voting holiday, low voter turnout when compared with western liberal democracies, corporate money in the process (inb4 ""but shillary,"" one candidate took the stage and pledged to appoint justices to overturn citizens united, and it wasn't trump), our failure to educate young Americans on civic responsibility, foreign governments actively attempting to subvert our process (*cough* Russia *cough*), totally inadequate polling stations in urban areas, etc, etc, etc.

But that's not what he does. When he's ahead, the polls are great, the people are great, the process is great. When he's down? Literally everything is rigged ooooo woe is me.

Jesus fuck how can you call yourself a trump supporter and not be embarrassed at this point?"

2898,3,"> I keep wondering why she didn't remind him that she was a senator, not a dictator.

And she was only senator for 12 years, not 30.   30 years ago Hillary Clinton the First Lady of Arkansas.    She was supposed to have a major impact on the country from that position?  Have any other First Ladies of Arkansas affected our lives in any way?"
2899,3,"Because it has to play in subtext.  Running for president, you can't project powerlessness even if it makes perfect sense.  The expectation is that a person running for president should have been corralling the senate themselves by putting forward, championing, and ensuring a vote for legislation.  To a point that's a totally reasonable expectation: senators can be very influential and we do want the best of the best for the highest office, but even when it isn't reasonable you can't say it.  Even a voter who understands the complexities can have their opinions colored by the implication of weakness."

2919,3,"He had way better control, but some of the framing of his questions were weird."
2920,1,"I think his framing was very much from a Conservative/GOP/Fox News sort of angle, which isn't a huge shock considering where he works.

I liked it a bit though, because I thought it cut to a lot of issues that GOP/Conservative voters have with Hillary and Trump, and while it should've helped Trump by being more in his supposed 'sweet spot', it was such an incoherent, rambling mess most the time, it completely eliminated the advantage.  Conversely, it gave Clinton an opportunity to really face the 'tough' questions and hammer home solid answers (though she certainly pivoted from a few questions I think we all would've liked some more direct answers to).

In total, I think the debate was a microcosm of what (some of) Fox News and mainstream conservatives feel about Trump and the election - they don't like Clinton, but they know Trump is an asshat and a terrible choice.  I thought Wallace did a service by giving questions that allowed Clinton to really speak directly to the fears of moderate conservatives, and really make her case as being a perfectly acceptable and reasonable candidate for President - not this crazy boogie man that the alt-right and hardliners have...trumped...her up to be.
