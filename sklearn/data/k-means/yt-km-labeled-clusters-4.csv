0,3,"I'm sick and tired of those who say Hillary has no great accomplishments. I 
would say staying out of prison for the crimes she committed in the last 
four decades is a great accomplishment."
1,3,"This is almost terrifying to watch! how can any of these two rule a 
country! #Nobodyforpresident"
2,3,Who's watching this after the election.

seats. and OML if Hilary smiles one more time, I swear I'm gonna jump off 
this roof."
5,3,"You know what's weird? Trump says Mexicans should go back to Mexico,Muslims 
should go back to the west, But he doesn't like saying that americans are 
immigrants."
6,3,"I really don't care what happens because the president doesn't have all the 
power. The U.S.A's main governmental power is divided into three branches, 
as we all know: The Executive Branch, The Legislative Branch, and The 
Judicial Branch. If the president wants to sent out new laws, 2/3 of the 
Legislative Branch must agree on it, or else it would be overwrited."
7,3,THEY BOTH NEED TO STOP INTERRUPTING THAT POOR MAN !!!!!!!!!!
8,2,why is trump always so triggered
9,3,"I don't live in the US, have never been there (I'd love to go though), but

17,3,We are soooo going to miss President Obama! 😔😔😔
18,0,"If Hillary Clinton was a ship, she would be called the Titanic! And Donald 
Trump is the iceberg! And we all know what happened to the Titanic!"
19,1,"even though I am a Muslim, even though I am not gonna vote, yet I would 
never vote for a fake person such as Clinton! her laughs, her smiles, her 
answers, even her her nodding are all fake."
20,3,Hilary is a criminal.
21,3,"THANK YOU LORD that I live in South Africa. I just have to choose between a 
bald ass penguin and a nincampoop!!!!"
22,3,"I feel like Trump and Hilary are two divorced parents fighting over custody 
of us, but we kinda just wana go live with grandma."
23,0,"I love Donald Trump. I hate Hilary Cliton! Because she is such a liar and 
she didn't deserve to be president. Donald Trump won the election last 
week, and I'm happy because he and Mike Pence Vice President are going to 
make America great again!"
24,3,"Trump was right. Stop and Frisk did help a lot. According to wall street 
journal, Homicide, Rape and Robbery increased and has been since the new 
person came in"
25,3,"This is literally two grown adults talking over each other like children. 
Seriously, no respect for each other nor for the guy trying to keep them on

30,3,Bye im moving to Dubai! ;)
31,3,"They are both awful, Trump has business sense but it also racist and 
sexist. Hillary is corrupt but has experience in government, though she 
shouldn't become US President just because she is a woman. Bernie Sanders 
was the only good choice now America is screwed"
32,2,Trump just needs to shut up.
33,3,"if trump wins, im movin to japan"
34,0,I hate Donald Trump he is sick

50,3,"ok guys I'm gonna get a little emotional here. excuse my ""yelling"". GUYS 
YOU HEAR THE WORD ON THE STREET THAT TRUMP IS RACIST AND THAT HILLARY IS 
DOING BAD THINGS. OK BUT NOT ALL OF IT IS TRUE. YES IN PREVIOUS COMMENTS I 
TEASED THE CANDIDATES. YES THATS ALL FUN AND GAMES. BUT NOW WHEN IT GETS 
SERIOUS. WHEN YOU HAVE TO FREAKING GROW UP. SURE IM NOT OLD ENOUGH TO VOTE 
YET. BUT WHEN YOU DO TAKE MY WORDS. THE MEMES, THE LIES, THE JOKES. WHEN 
YOU VOTE. DONT YOU DARE THINK OF ONE OF THOSE. EVER. LOOK AT THEIR 
BACKGROUND. LOOK AT WHAT THEY DO FOR A LIVING. LOOK AT WHAT THEY ARE SAYING 
WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. OK SURE DONALD TRUMP INNTERUPTS HILLARY A WHOLE LOT. 
BUT THATS WHAT THEY DO IN DEBATES. THEY FIGHT AND ARGUE. JUST LIKE 
SIBLINGS. SO WHEN YOU VOTE. THINK OF THE REAL THINGS. THATS HOW YOU TRULY 
FIND THE BEST CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT. SURE IF THEY LIE ON WHAT THEY SAY 
YOU KNOW WHAT AMERICA NEEDS THEN. EVERYBODY IS HATING ON OBAMA. BUT YOU 
GUYS VOTED ON HIM FOR EIGHT YEARS. SO IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH WHAT IM 
SAYING RIGHT NOW TELL ME. I BELIEVE WHAT I BELIEVE I HAVE PASSED A TEST ON 
POLITICS. I LEARNED HOW TO EVALUATE A CANDIDATE. YOU CAN NOW PICK AND 
CHOOSE. AND LIKE I SAID IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS TELL ME BECAUSE I 
NEVER SAID WHO I THINK IS BETTER. NOW AMERICA I LEAVE THIS IN YOUR HANDS. 
Thank you and have a nice day.😉"
51,3,"Sure, trump is sexual predator, a racist, a charlatan, and a big idiot, 
but, who cares? He is just going to be president of united states, and 
nobody should worry?"
52,3,"im so sick of listening to hillary bs. with her fake smile and her lies.

America! So happy I don't live there"
56,1,People please vote for HILLARY!!!!
57,3,"She is worthless, and a THEIF !! Thank God she lost, congrats to PRESIDENT 
ELECT TRUMP !"
58,3,"Do you really want that person to be the next president, maybe he has good 
points, but is a terrible human being, he is the most horrific person after 
Hitler"
59,3,"I'm really scared. I don't like any of them but it's been my life long 
dream to live in America. I'm turkish and of course a muslim, if Donald 
Trump wins i won't be able to move to USA. I'm feeling so stressed and I've 
already planned my future in USA with my cousin/best friend, it all will 
crash down if he wins. I'm not saying Hillary is better or smarter but 
seriously he has a lot of dumb ideas, he wants to remove muslims from the 
country and build a wall. Many families will be separated! I understand 
that he mostly thinks about ISIS but that doesn't mean all of the muslims 
are dangerous. 95% muslims are really peaceful. I wouldn't even hurt a fly."
60,1,do not vote for Donltromp or Hilerycliton!‼‼!😧
61,2,trump goes off topic alot if you havent notice
62,3,"This is why I'm for Johnson! Let him debate! Before you come at me with 
Aleppo, remember the missing e-mails on Hillary's side and Trump's 'locker 
room' talk. Before you say how he blanked and couldn't name a foreign 
leader, remember Trump's missing tax returns and Hillary defending a child 
who was raped. Every candidate has flaws. Obviously Johnson will not win, 
but that's not why I'm voting for him. I'm voting for him to send a 
message! I want actual candidates to vote for!

Hillary's ideas of a higher minimum wage and a debt free college are 
unrealistic. Higher minimum wage will only cause inflation and cause the 
value of the US dollar to go down. Minimum wage is just that! Minimum wage, 
it's for entry level positions such as fast food. You will see higher pay 
if you actually applied yourself. So sit your whining asses down! You're 
not looking or applying yourself hard enough! Quit trying to get everything 
handed to you! Debt free college is unrealistic. I don't want my tax money 
to go help a student go to college and flunk out of remedial classes 
because they messed up back in high school or where ever they were 
educated. That's unrealistic, which removes Jill Stein from the equation.

Trump's idea on abortion and gay marriage are too old fashioned for the 
America we have today. Maybe work on the adoption programs and foster care 
we have in place before worrying about being against abortion. He sounds 
like a complete idiot. He'll run America like a business and not like a 
country. 

That's my opinion (as a current college student working a part-time job 
which technically is on minimum wage but + tips)."
63,3,"I just need to ask the Trump supporters, is Trump a racist? I want to 
suport him over the witch but not if hes a racist."
64,3,"Hilary and Trump are both racists and hate gay people and immigrants so why 
make Hilary look better."
65,3,IM COUNTING DOWN THE HOURs UNTIL AMERICA PERISHES.
66,3,"Donald Trump sounds like he's literally just playing the blame game and his 
plans sound like they rely a lot on 'if we can do this' or on other people 
- when that doesn't work what's his plans then?
A third world country? This man is truly despicable, how about you go and 
live in a third world country then come back and tell me your sob story 
about airports in the US.
As soon as he starts talking about Nuclear and not taking it off the table 
that should have shut his campaign down instantly."
67,0,"As a Brit can someone explain to me how Hillary Clinton won the most votes 
in election but Donald Trump is President Elect?"
68,3,"My god she is a smug pos. Anyone voting for this liar/murderer is as 
corrupt and evil as she is"
69,1,That sexual predator trump is disgusting. No woman shold vote for him.
70,3,"This lying bitch got what she deserved. She can now go with her satanic 
friends and eat the blood, sperm and breast milk food they love to gorge 
on. Disgusting freaks."
71,3,"Trump is misleading citizens and humanity, and he is a bad influence for 
anybody in a very tragic way. All he promotes is hate, racism, and bigotry. 
And he is lying to everybody."
72,3,"Only idiots, racist, and bigots support that sexual predator trump. Some 
people just love bullshit."
73,3,"I love how Trump in all of the debates, he always wore the American flag. 
True American. He will make America great again. :)"
74,3,"Trump is the worst person for president any nation could even have. This 
has to be some kind of joke or a nightmare."
75,3,"""The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African American 
men""!? What an oversimplified view of a much deeper social problem. Typical 
leftist taking every opportunity to disarm the public."
76,3,"A sexual predator and the foreinger gold diger in the white house are like 
an abomination. What the hell is going on?"
77,3,"You know guys it is getting down to the wire.  In two days you have to vote 
for president.  Try to put your total feelings aside, I know that neither 
one are great, but what you have to do is look at the one who is most 
worthy..  Clinton who has stole from the country, is on the hit list of the 
FBI,  who is a liar... A women who wants to keep Health Care Reform going 
which is falling in the tanks but the even more disturbing problem is that 
she wants to make it a Single Payer System, Government controlled if you 
don't know what that means.   Meaning that the Government is going to say 
what you can and cannot do in regard to your Healthcare.  That is sad..  Is 
that what you want or the Man who yes may be a little troubled when it 
comes to talking about Women ( which I do not believe all of the omen that 
have SUDDENLEY come about their story) a man who yes took advantage of the 
loop holes in taxes but wants to do something about it,  Who does have good 
ideas on keeping the illegals out while keeping those who work legally in. 
It's on your shoulders now.  Try to make the best decision you can clearly 
thinking who has the best in mind for us.  Do not vote for a Women because 
she is a Women that is ridiculous and if you do you should feel ashamed."
78,3,"TRUMP IS S LOW CLASS, CON ARTIST, BIG LIAR AND THIEF!!! HE'S A SELFISH EVIL 
DEMON!! I CAN NOT BELIEVE YOU STUPID, IGNORANT, LOW SELF ESTEEM WHITE MEN

firstly ???"
91,3,"That charlatan trump is always making up false storys and lieng about 
everything. He is just a hateful man, a deceiver, and a big fraud. He is a 
racist and a sexual predator."
92,3,"How to know when Clinton is lying? She opens her mouth. Also, she had a 
'tell', as a professional card player would say. Every time she sort of 
'scratched' her face it was to say to Lester Holt, 'throw it to me', and he 
did. Such corruption."
93,3,"HEY TRUMP SUPPORTERS! Yes, you! I want you to give me some reasons to vote 
for Trump. Valid reasons, not just ""Hillary deleted some emails! She is so 
evil!"". I'm a complete democrat, but let's see you try. Don't worry, I 
won't change my views, I just like a good argument that involves Trump. 
Come on, let's hear why Hillary isn't as good as Trump!"
94,1,I vote for Hilary Clinton 🇺🇸
95,3,"Americans if President Clinton, it will be a war in the world, she was sick

Clinton had FBI investigation about her email. Donald Trump refused to 
allow his Taxes release or investigation By The I.R.S that's some B.S. 
Howard Stern had Donald trump on the he show he say in confession that he 
goes in the women dress room uninvited cause he own it. WTF is wrong with 
Donald trump supporters there been my individual analysis Trump and Hillary 
Clinton taxes reforms. These independent analysis say donald trump would 
put 4 trillions on the nation debt and hillary clinton would be a slow 1 
percent growth in economy."
125,3,"trump has the alter ego of an annoying, bratty, self-righteous 12 yr old

136,3,"This has been interesting to re-watch. Hillary actually started slinging 
dirt first and was the first to mention a ""special prosecutor"". So glad 
Trump won!"
137,3,"the truth is that donald is a business man (child) who has an ideal to 
improve mostly the economy, whether it will work or not no one knows 
because he doesnt have any government experience. His tendencies and 
judgement are irratic and if any thing was to go from bad to worse itd be 
with donald because he IS a ruthless business person, Not a politician. You 
can even tell that he can't even answer half the questions properly; only 
deflecting with hatred and other negative comments about hilarys past.
Hilary is a traitor blah blah but at least she has apologized. She also 
knows how to stop and listen which is important if neither of them have 
been a president before... Also if bill clinton comes along with hilary how 
do we know he wont have any input in making americas economy good again 
also.
What you all dont see is that pass all the fact checking through these 
debates, donald should only be an economic advisor at best.... to say 
worthy of being a president is beyond ridiculous. 
Americans should worry about the people who are voting for trump because i 
would love to hear a rational argument for once."

and she has a far from perfect track record but c'mon. Trump puts us back

college debt not to mention the online worth it gets very 
frustrating???????????"
212,3,"Trump mentioned that the African American community has been let down by 
our politicians. Trump is most likely right. The differences is that 
opponents did not like hearing those words from his mouth. And HIllary 
mentioned that Bias is a systemic and national problem in our country which 
is true also. I did not watch this debate live. Although most political 
experts deemed Hillary the winner from this debate, this 1st debate seemed 
to be much more civil than the 2nd and 3rd debates. Both candidates spoke 
well on some topics in regards to police training & racial bias. They 
weren't actually going at each other's throats on those topics. Trump had 
major points about government instability. He did nail it in regards to the 
costs and charging of spending. When I was in the Army, I had to perform 
something called PMCS checks on a Humvee assigned to me. And it nearly took 
a year and a half to receive the chains ordered for the hummer assigned to 
me. I and my fellow soldiers would scratch our heads on why something so 
mundane as chains for tires took so long to order? There could have been 
other factors too such as leadership above us dragging their feet within 
our ""chain of command"" submitting the order. Trust me when I say this, I'm 
proud to be a veteran in the US Army, but at least the Army that I was 
assigned to often did not get the job done in an expedient manner. I'm just 
telling it like it is. I'm sure other branches of service may have similar 
experiences about the virtual bureaucratic red tape that exists within all 
forms of the military and federal government. Our leadership could have 
thrown money together in a pot and bought chains at a local auto parts 
store for some tires needed to complete our inventories. But that was of 
course considered illegal because the chains that the government 
must approve of all certified parts and must go through proper channels. 
Which is agreeable. But again, there is no excuse that such a mundane part 
should have taken so long to order. Just my two cents on some of us in the 
military feeling the brunt of government inefficiency at that time. I'm 
sure there are still problems within all forms of federal spending."
213,3,wow. I'm more happy after watching these debates that I went with Trump.
214,3,I'm so glad Trump won! 🇺🇸
215,3,"Watching this after the vote, I can see why most of states where poorer

226,3,"Overall, I think Donald can help us out of debt; Think about it? We are 22 
trillion dollars in debt. Your children, children will have to pay it off. 
Additionally, Donald is decreasing the tax percentages, for business so 
they can stay here, in America. As we know, that a lot of our GOOD business 
are moving to Mexico...What happen to the good all days, when your grandma 
was getting paid good money for working hard; Example, good benefits, paid 
vacation, and business trips...

☺☺☺☺"
227,3,"The only factor is not the work who speak with him by the Minister and 
Secretary"
228,3,"Everyone's so worried about Donald Trump causing another world war with 
some other country, but seeing that him and Putin are on friendly terms, 
there's a very unlikely chance that a nuclear war or a similar war decades 
ago will reoccur. That's how I see it right now. And if in fact a war does 
break out, then it won't be a problem for America, taking in consideration 
about how advanced our military technology is and our allies, which are 
superpowers in this world. Trump is a bully and bigot. His behavior is at 
times unacceptable, and I dislike how he expresses his ideas. However, I 
believe, as a Republican and a Christian, that his campaign is not 
outrageous nor is it worse than Clinton's. He is also very clean when it 
comes to politics because he has no previous affiliations with politicians. 
However, being a main factor is why people voted for Clinton, her extensive 
background in politics makes her more vulnerable to having to put interest 
to her 'fellow' politicians if she won the election. Her lies would become 
bigger and bigger, just like her email issues. Her view on social issues 
clash greatly with mine, and I think that was a major factor in the 
reasoning of why I support Trump. These days, social issues are a huge deal 
to many people and the sensitivity to it has increased dramatically. 
Although Trump is a man who was never affiliated with politics/military and 
is solely a business man, you could obviously tell by the results of this 
election that he prudently calculated the probability of him winning, which 
was a main reason in his decision to run. Also, many people claim Trump is 
'gay'. Seeing that a) they insult him based on his sexuality or made-up 
sexuality b) they look down on him because of how is reported to be 'gay', 
they aren't fit to be a supporter of both the Democrat or Republican side. 
These hypocrites (Clinton supporters) who slam him down because they think 
he is homosexual is going against what the Democrats sought for: accepting 
everyone, whether or not they're gay or lesbian, transgender, a minority or 
Caucasian, etc.. These sorts of nonsense commentary about him and his 
personal life doesn't affect anyone, but just degrades the anonymous users 
behind these computer screens because of their seemingly uneducated 
background by using that type of diction. I think I covered most of the 
reasons why I support Trump and his campaign to #makeamericagreatagain. I 
hope those who read this will respect my opinion, and will take it into 
consideration before talking smack about Trump again. Thank you and let's 
see what America has in store for everyone. Good night."

334,3,"Hi im British 
I have been listening to this whilst working and some problems im picking 
up with Trump
Is that is very vague in his answers leaving it open to perception and 
people can set them selves up to a false outcome

One thing im noticing his on about slashing taxes, but then his on about 
policing the streets with stop and search

Taxes help pay for public services (Well thats how it works in the UK, and 
I would imagine its the same if not similar in the US) so how do you reduce 
the government income to then say hey, we now going to milk the pot by 
putting police on the streets doing stop and searches) which risks 
segregation.

You have this strerotype that black men from ""Hoods"" or poor neighborhoods 
are heavily involved in armed crime (such as the cribs vs bloods) now I am 
not saying every black male does this so please dont twist my words, but I 
am saying if this stereotype exists you will get a lot of people being 
unnecessarily frisked, this will cause people to feel oppressed by the 
police and where this is still fresh in the black community specially since 
they havent let the whole Rodney King incident lie and that was over 25 yrs 
ago, 

Whilst previously I was a trump supporter just out of ludicracy and seing a 
change
If i was to be serious for a moment, I feel trump will be negative for the 
US

Not saying Hilliary is perfect look at the Email scandal, but she has the 
mannerism is more professional and more suited to the role that Trump, its 
just a shame its boiled down to therse two canditates for the US,

Some may argue whats it to do with the UK.
The USA is a powerhouse, its one of the largest bodies and influencial 
countries in the world and a lot of political decisions that take place in 
the US eventually affect other countries

I dont think it will be as dramatic as some people make out when 
interviewing the general public on the news, there will always be advisors 
the president has and the last thing you want is to anger the people you 
serve as they can turn on you, history shows this

Presidents have been known to have been assasenated, so i dont think for a 
moment it will cause the end of the world, but i dont think some of their 
decisions wont be detrimental to people ie Wars in syria or russia with no 
fly zones, or breaking the american bank and make america fall into further 
debt, poverty, crime will increase etc and wars can break out between other 
countries such as Mexico and its alies

Not sure if it would play out like that but I guess we will find out after 
tonight"

everything and that has been proven time and time again that it is a LIE.
Anyone that votes for Hillary is agreeing to continue conforming to 
Government Brain Washing and Lies. If you are happy with the way the 
Government is Today, and Do Not Want or Care if it Changes for the Better, 
Then Go Ahead and Vote For More Consistent Failure, and Believe the Lies 
That You Will Be Told to Cover up Her Failures if you put her in the White 
House. 
She Knows if Trump is Elected That All the Truth Will Finally Come Out, as 
it Should,
WAKE UP AMERICA - NO MORE LIES
Do Yourself a Favor and Vote For Trump as President of the UNITED STATES of 
AMERICA"

is a Disgusing Man, he uses his money to buy people and votes. His idea's 
are ludicrous he is a great trouble maker, if he was to become President 
people would find out where they stood, oh not in ""Trump Land"" he does not 
give a chite about you, once he has your vote you will be like a bit of 
bubble gum tossed into the gutter. Do you really think he cares about you, 
No No, he just wants adoration. Go on Bow to Trump, you will all regret it. 
But I am but a single voice, so why should you care, but please please do 
he is not built to be a Leader of a Great Country, he is good in business, 
that is obvious, but that does NOT make him a good leader of such a great 
Country as I have said before before. It would be very immature of us to 
really really put our trust in any Politicians, I would not trust one as 
far as I could throw one. but we all have to in our Countries, I Pray that 
the Americans who I admire will make the right choice and thereafter live a 
decent life. God be with you all."

business man and has no background in politics AND to top it all off, he's 
openly racist. Y'all don't realize how big of a mistake yall made electing 
this creepy clown as president. He's not about to help anybody out unless 
you're wealthy. He's not about to ""Make America Great Again"" he's about to

naive to think that a president has that kind of power today, 
especially if they ever openly oppose the power elite.
 We've been riding a bloated, wasteful infrastructure for decades beyond
what it can handle - because it is profitable for people such as these
two ! 
Our society is rife with corruption, so much that we do not have the 
stomach or resolve to make the simplest of changes. We've already got 
plenty of fine ideas and solutions - but we can't act on them 
effectively. For one, our sovereignty was severely damaged with the 
creation of the 
Fed and The Great Depression (95+% of our gold was mandated by law to 
sell to foreign gold market-flippers in the 1930s - and afaik fort knox 
has not been audited since, amongst a multitude of other tragedies) . 
T-Rump is an egotist and a bullshitter extraordinaire that's winging it
on 9 of every 10 talking points... while Shillary's transgressions are 
already documented over 30+ yrs of public life. Either could be impeached 
right quick if elected.

general consensus of the american voter and their frustration...
we are fighting a campaign that concedes the reality of, ""[a]s a nation we 
are stronger together in order to adjust and resurrect a robust economy 
nationally"". The republican party has it's agenda based on, ""[w]e gotta 
save the country from those (""Stronger Together"") voters""; because they are 
causing a massive degree of harm to themselves...
Think about it folks and get out and vote for Hillary...then turn to your 
Republican advocate and give them the finger ""index of coarse"" right to the 
face and say...""get a grip"" we're gonna survive this G.W.Bush Holocaust if 
you'd just stop panicking!!!"

minutes. What does that tell you. That they're simply nervous? Who blinks

Is this not prepared by both sides as well as anticipated? Are they not 
trying to make points that were written for them based on what they believe 
in? Hearing each other's comments they are both taken aback and wonder what 
they're saying themselves is right or wrong. Because it's been prepared. 
Because they hear an argument that is decent against their prepared 
monologue. Each of these candidates fear each other and are afraid of what 
each other will actually do if elected.

There's always what is promised and what actually will happen. I've never 
voted once in my life and these two prominent candidates make me want to 
vote even less than ever. I don't want either one as my country's leader."

about politics the only reason I am voting is
to keep hillary clinton out of the white house. due to her mishandling of 
classified information, her taking massive amounts of
money from corporate backers, due to her sociopathic use of accusations of 
sexual misconduct against her opponent while having silenced multiple 
victims of sexual assault in the past when it suited her, her pulling money 
out of her foundation that
was intended to help people she insist's are going to be oppressed by her 
opponents, as well a large number of people who were supposed to testify 
against her have turned up dead and the fact she will likely start ww3 with 
russia I would have to say for me this election is about the morality of 
the candidates and don't misunderstand I don't think donald trump is an 
angel 
but even though I am a libertarian I would sacrifice every political view I 
have to keep that warmongering sociopath out of the white house I WOULD 
HAVE VOTED FOR BERNIE SANDERS OVER HER AND HE AND I DONT AGREE ON ANYTHING.
I feel sorry for american democrats that this wretched woman managed to 
sabotage bernies bid for the democratic nomination
as while I don't agree with his politics I wouldn't have bothered to vote 
against him since I think he is just a human with 
different political views then me and not actually a bad person (at least 
by politician standards) this woman stole your dnc nomination, she has 
silenced victims of sexual assault when it suited her, she breaks the laws 
of this country whenever she wants, is in the pocket of numerous corporate 
backers, is suspected though not proven guilty by myself and others of 
having people who testify against her killed, has been disgustingly 
contempt filled towards her own supporters in her emails,and people who 
work for her HAVE BEEN CAUGHT ON VIDEO admitting to voter fraud, and 
inciting violence at trump rallies.
AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF she is attempting actions that could spark a third 
world war. american liberals I implore you please
do not vote for this women she doesn't care about you,she has galvanized 
your opposition in this race,she has stolen your nomination from you, shown 
contempt for you,and lied to you. I understand fully your dislike of donald 
trump on both a personal level as he is brash and vulgar and on a political 
level I will never fault you for disagreeing with me or mister trump 
about political issues but the worst the man will do deregulate american 
business and make it difficult to immigrate to this country hillary will 
start a world war please don't let this sociopath play you. sanders or 
someone else can be elected on the
next go around but we have to have not been nuked in the next four years 
for that to happen PLEASE don't vote for her.
that said I hold no contempt for you even if you ignore me here. if you 
read this far I thank you for your time 
and regardless of weather this changes your opinion or you just move one or 
even if you spend the next week flaming me

1. Act like a child.
2. Speak like a child.
3. Never answer the prompt (aka question).
4. Interrupt Hilary constantly while continuously telling her to shut up

I have never been into politics until now. The person who wins this 
election affects my future in this country. My God. Trump would only bring 
this country to hell. I would rather die than live in this country with him 
as president. Thankfully, I don't think he will win this election. 
Honestly, Hilary isn't my first choice but she's still better than Trump.
(P.S. Trump, I don't think running a country is like running a business.)"

615,3,"I am standing back in amazement at the reaction of the world and especially 
the American people st this election. When the freedoms that Americans have 
enjoyed and now take for granted these fiascos happen. St a recent election 
in my small suburb of approximately 20,000. 900 people turned out to vote 
on local matters. city council, milages etc. Then all 20,000 complained at 
the results. We are very young country. less than 250 years old. And this 
sickness cthat has set in in America is sickness that is best to have when 
your still young. We have to learn that can no longer rely on our system to 
filter out laws, politicians etc. we sit blind to in there birthing phase 
then wonder how all this happened. A democracy is no better than the values 
of the people. America will survive this mess and hopefully learn from it. 
How many of us go or have ever gone to a city council meeting? We vote for 
drain commissioner. How many know what a drain commissioner is let alone 
qualifications? If we choose to ignore or system of govt. then it's 
participants will always have the final say. It is what it is. Nothing we 
can do about the past. But, with this election as a reminder, maybe we can 
help our future."

637,3,"*Did he seriously just say $650 million isn't a lot?!* 0:37:00

is who they were stopping and frisking, the reasons why, and how they were 
prosecuted versus those who weren't stopped and frisked and not prosecuted, 
for the same crimes if any crimes at all. They're also so cowardly both 
Trump and Clinton not saying what the true issue is. Most of the guns here 
increasing gun crime are illegal gun owners. It has nothing to do with 
buying and background checks, because a 14 yr old gang banger isn't getting 
background checks because they're not buying guns. That means the 
government is not writing and enforcing proper and effective laws on 
imports. And they're also scared shitless of the NRA."

736,1,"if you support or vote for Trump, you deserve the disaster he brings you"
737,2,"According to Forbes, ""under Trumps new plan, every income group would still 
get tax cuts but upper income households would receive most of the relief, 
not only in dollars, but as a percentage of income. The poorest 20% of 
households would get tax cut averaging just $110, raising their after tax 
income by 0.8%. Middle income households would save an average of $1,010, 
boosting their after tax income by 1.5%. some moderate income single 
parents would actually end up paying HIGHER individual income taxes, since 
Trump would eliminate the ""head of household"" filing status, meaning they 
would be treated the same as singles when it comes to both the standard 
deduction and the tax bracket. in addition some large families would also 
pay more, since the personal exemption would be eliminated by Trump's 
plan."""

choice in history to pick a leader. Your screwed either way no matter who 
you pick. But instead of picking another Clinton which lied to you already 
about her own husband why not give the business man a chance. By taxing the 
rich and bigger companies more surely that will only make them leave and 
thus taking their jobs with them. Surely Trumps idea of taxing imports more 
and cutting business tax would be a better treat for share holders and 
owners of the big corps. Yeh Trump is a loud mouth outspoken sexiest pig 
but at least he's honest about it. Clinton is the most fake lying thing ive 
seen running politics since Tony Blair."

amazed how stupid and out of control Trump looks and sound like, extremely

be, but he won't be able to convince me that he cares about me as an 
individual. I may admire his sense of business and making money but that's 
by far not the most important thing America needs. He's missing the most 
important part; a leader needs to connect to his highest character, being 
compassionate and humble. Trump doesn't know what those are at this point, 
he needs to mature a lot before given such power of leading a nation."

789,3,"Peaple you are correct about them. I know something that would shock the 
world. The Antichrist gave them a extra power to there own power that would 
floor you. I have Proof and i cannot explain how but i can say allot about 
it. The Power gave to the Queen by the Antichrist is Youth and other things 
with it. The Antichrist has shocking power inside him to keep peaple alive 
wile torchoring peaple for years and to give Youth to anyone. The 
Antichrist can remove Deadly illeness out of anyone and give it to anyone. 
Antichrist is very evil and i think you all know why? Who is the devil? 
Hint? What power in the Devil is possable in the years of the Antichrist. 
They can do anything and i am not kidding around they can walk through 
walls stand around were you cannot see them. Home privacy is invaded in 
mean manners you are being watched in the bathroom at home in your bedroom 
at home. Your being laughed at! The Royals are not so nice and not anymore. 
There is allot more to this power. The Queen goes out in public looking 
normal and in secret privacy not even peaple that work for her knows. There 
could be a few workers that have agreed the secret or elce. She looks young 
with her Husband. She is way different looking than her young adult years. 
We are talking bigger Breast and a body women dream about. The other Royals 
have taken some of these powers to secretly look better to advance there 
looks. They were given energy to stay awake at all hours of the night also. 
The Antichrist can here peaple in the worlds thinking. There know what you 
think at all times the Queen also took that on With her Husband. They think 
evil thoughts about the peaple in the world along with this Antichrist. The 
Antichrist has been here for years and be honest with yourselfs and ask 
yourself when was this mark given to you years ago. Do anyone of you 
remember a strange males voice in your homes asking you if you were a 
christian?! That was the Antichrist. He would keep asking until you gave a 
awnser and it made you scared maby, confused maby. When you said no that 
you were not a Christian, Guess what? You got marked by Satan from the 
Antichrist. It happend! They did this to the world quick and sneaky for 
most peaple in the world. The high power leaders communicate with him. The 
world is now a sick evil joke and some of the High power leaders is in 
pretend mode with humans with some stuff they do. There lives are easy in 
ways and they live off powers to have more fun it's like better than a 
fairytail for them. our leaders are pulling your chain now! They will 
always make things look normal in front of your faces and your hearing. 
They gave Vanity and great bodies to certain peaple and we are talking 
major Vanity here. Satan is evil in Vanity issues and it happend through 
the Antichrist! There was a deal made with these select high power peaple 
from the Antichrist and he gave them this Vanity and energy and knowledge 
more than anyone could understand. They are up wile the world sleeps! They 
trully don't care about you. It is not just the peaple torchoring that they 
hate it is everyone in the world. They care for there family but there not 
so concerned about you. The Antichrist Hates all Human peaple in this 
world! It's like he became Satan himself when Satan gave him Power to give 
the Mark in the first place."

un-politically inclined and uninformed the american public is about what is 
important and essential to making our system of life function in this 
country. No one here even knows what nafta or the trans pacific partnership 
is or how much it has stolen money from the average american and funneled 
it to the top. People seem to 'THINK' that Trump represents all that we 
don't like about republicans. But you people forget that he isn't a career 
politician it's just the ticket he is on. Because they are misinformed 
about what has been going on for years but he actually isn't in bed with 
nearly as many people as Clinton is. Yes words are said and the media 
doesn't miss a thing but any person worth their salt has stirred the pot. 
The 1950s was the high watermark of the american economy anyone who did 
well was able to afford their own home and have access to a quality of life 
that every human being should be entitled to. I am not saying there wasn't 
a lot of social issues though. But regardless everything has gone downhill

810,3,"I gotta say.. Trump's plan about reducing taxes and removing regulations.. 
are indeed what can make new jobs. 
Here in Brazil for example, it's an absurd amount of taxes so even if we

the taxes are so damn high that we can't even pay that. Companies like 
Nintendo, Xiaomi..and others are indeed leaving my country."

realize Hillary is flawed and corrupt in many ways herself (as, most 
certainly, is the Donald), however, the fact that he believes his greatest 
trait is his temperament?!?!?! just goes to show how poor his judgment 
really is. Plus, if that really is his greatest trait then he's a lot worse 
off than even I realized. Even based solely on this debate, anyone can see 
how poor his temperament really is- especially when shown in stark contrast 
to the composure, poise and grace she maintained in the face of the most 
rude and crude and bufoonishly ignorant Trump chump. Childish attacks and 
low blows and failed attempts at riling your opponent with below the belt 
insults and lies do not a good temperament make."

criticizes Hillary. Also, his dumb idea to ""build a wall"" is terrible! How 
can this man become president. Anyway, i find Hillary slightly better 
because she has experience from Bill Clinton. That's not only why, but 
Hillary can make the democracy a better place and totally doesn't make fun

from Austria( NO NOT AUSTRALIA, AUSTRIA) and there is no question about 
""who to vote for"". It´s simple: Everything about trump got leaked(playboy 
etc) but was that really that bad? I mean, what´s so bad about someone who 
has some stuff going on, that shouldn´t even interest anybody outside his 
family. Ever heard about privacy? But Hillary is just evil. And to all the 
people that say"" I hate trump he said some pervert stuff""´: SHUT THE 
FU**UP. You don´t even wanna know how the austrian people are laughing 
about the hillary voters. Even in school we learn how hillary is going to 
destroy the world if she wins. It´s simple: Hillary just wants the power, 
she doesn´t care for the normal people LIKE YOU, she will just help the 
rich ones-trust me. If i see trump I see someone who did some mistakes, if 
i see hillary i see someone who will do mistakes. And even if I ignore 
everything I already siad: I can´t look at Hillary without seeing someone 
who WILL start a war. 
My mother always says to me that there is no election-because hillary got 
the right people on her side and that your vote doesn´t count because she 
already won.

IF THAT HAPPENS: ARM YOURSELF AND PROTECT YOURSELF AGAINST HER. If voters 
can´t stop her, bullets can.

crushing the working class by paying slave wages all while they pile money 
up to the moon at the greatest rate in history.

more money that you do not even need. There are real issues with Clinton

debated.

How is a law going to affect a criminal? Criminals don't obey the laws; if 
a criminal wants something, they get it. No amount of legislation or laws 
will change that.

The firearm laws are all I really know about Bill Clinton, but I do know

1003,3,This debate meh..
1004,3,Bernie for pres
1005,3,"My point of view about this debate:
1) I think there should be some other candidate for President. It sounded 
both were just roasting each other. 
Instead of talking about the country they are just talking about each other.
2) Plans of trump like cutting Tax is very good. Because in long run this 
will work if we study this 
system properly, it answers itself. Because cutting tax will get jobs back 
and addition to few more plans that will
bring more jobs, makes it perfect. Even though Hillary thinks other way 
round pointing towards middle class but 
the number of jobs it will make is less than the jobs that will be lost. 
Also cutting tax to wealthy class or 
business people should come with constraints of employment to automatically 
concentrate on the whole countries 
financial issue and employment. Also investments and concentration on 
Research and development, innovation and small 
business will lead to increase in employment.
3) Race Question: It can be done by giving equal opportunities to all races 
and legally taking action against 
those who discriminate. And create a community, having all races as 
employees in every sector, who will manage all the 
complaints related to race, which will be answered directly by the 
President and will run independently. And this community 
should be easily accessible. Educational system should also be targeted to 
teach kids to help remove race discrimination. 
Because the knowledge and habits at the early age is more effective. 
Problem of races is problem of all countries so the 
above things I mentioned is good at Presidential level but this is actual 
work of everyone of us.

This is just my opinion!"

Stop and frisk law isn't unconstitutional, it was where they were doing it 
that was. And New York murders are actually up."
1068,3,"I am deeply worried for the future of the People of USA. deeply worried for 
how this will affect the rest of the world."

realistic."
1071,2,BUUUURN TRUMP
1072,3,"Even JILL STEIN says in a recent interview ""HILLARY WILL START NUCLEAR WAR 
WITH RUSSIA BECAUSE OF HER POLICIES."" All other candidates in this election

2016 that can realize that Donald J. Trump , is not good for the US ,not 
only because he belittles women but because he is going to make dictator of 
Korea Kim jong Un want to bomb us even more... then adults should realize 
it to. i do not like Hillary but she has expirence in the politcial system 
so she is better than trump but at this point in the election anyone 
is.watch Michelle obamas speech about human decency and how trump should 
not brag about sexually asulting women and you will want to think twice 
about your vote for trump. On November the eighth 6 days from now vote for 
Hillary Clinton. Again this is from a 13 year old girls prespective. If 
adults can't see this then america...START THINKING FOR ONCE! Vote Hillary 
for president If YOU want to ""Make America Great Again"". Vote for Hillary 
Clinton for the president of the United States of America."

1088,3,"I'm not a fan of Hillary or Trump but overall Hillary seemed more prepared 
for this debate and even took notes during it. However towards the end of 
the debate Trump started to make more sense. I like his plan to take out 
ISIS fast ASAP."
1089,3,"Harambe for president!!!!!! Like comment if u agree!!!!! Btw I actually 
want Hillary to win!!!!!😂😂😂💯💯💯"
1090,3,"Republicans have a big lie , a racist, a bigot and a very stupid man named 
trump."
1091,3,"Trump and the republican are not good for the country, nor for the entire 
world. They are just racist, bigots, and idiots fearmongering and hating

stupid things but in all seriousness Hillary was there when Bill was the 
President and also when Obama was but nothing changed really. {ISIS was 
born.}"
1102,0,"I genuinely think Donald Trump may just win this. His straight talking 
policy sing right to a hell of a lot of Americans. But remember this if it 
ain't done the Trump way. It's the highway and that means America at War"

trump, really?"
1108,3,"Republicans supremacist now have the worse person runing for president any 
nation could ever have. That sexual predator must never win."
1109,2,"Republicans and the trump are all bullshit, bigotry, and racism. There is 
not even one sane mind around all of those supremacist idiots. Even their 
leader trump is just charlatan and a sexual predator."

1111,2,"I am not sure who is shittier. Killary or trumpster.
Can i trust trump that he will not start unnecessary wars against middle 
east countries? Can i even trust Killary?"
1112,3,"The ""Law and Order"" part is where I decided to vote for Hillary. She 
answered that question effectively. Trump just rambled saying ""law and 
order"" and ""stop and frisk"" while ignoring what's been said to be 
unconstitutional. Hillary even brought up mental health, more police 
training, etc. 

I tried very hard to look at both sides of this debate, without bias. Trump 
just seemed very unprepared and that's really not a trait (among many) 
commander in chief should posses."
1113,3,"Yes, they should just turn off the other person's mic til it is their turn, 
and also turn them off when time is up."
1114,3,Why are they just yelling at each other?
1115,2,bill clinton should've popped trump

how to run diplomacy and her mouth! BUT both have been proven to serve they 
own purposes so they are not capablr to be presidents ! makd one economic 
leader anc the other a diplomat in external issues long story sort : any of 
those two clows be president?.....og velieve me its gonna be baaaaad! PLUS 
old story: nothing will change ppl cause same authorities will ""still rule 
the country but wearing new clothes"" if you know what I mean!"
1118,0,guys. Donald trump is so a Donald duck. the look and everything
1119,2,Trump u sure u wouldnt be bttr off as a comedian?
1120,3,"The fact that this is a presidential debate should bore me, but I am 
actually entertained by this because this was actually funny which is 
really troubling and makes me worry for America. Because frankly neither of 
them should be president they didn't talk about the future of the United 
States but just tried to roast each other. But please Americans whatever 
you do don't vote for trump 😑"
1121,3,"he is absolutely disgusting, despicable"

me!😅🙈"
1170,3,"I'm Brazilian (therefore not much into American Elections) but correct me 
if I'm wrong...
USA must decide between voting for a crazy businessman who says mean things 
and a compulsive liar who does mean things, right? 

You're screwed either way, but one thing I can assure: I would never vote 
for the second option."
1171,3,AMERICA HAS TO CHOOSE BETWEEN BAD AND WORSE
1172,3,I watched this while doing my homework.
1173,3,"This is the best two hours of my life of watching these two biggest frauds 
pointing each other fault line rather than resorting a strategy how to fix 
this country up."
1174,3,"Do not vote if you don't want none of these two for president. It's your 
right to do so and expressing your discontent. Do not be blackmailed into 
voting a candidate in which you don't believe"
1175,3,"Hillary Clinton is, according to some people, in league with child 
traffickers and Satanic practitioners. Donald Trump is, according to some 
people, pals with Jeffery Epstein, owner of ‘pedo-island’. 

Who to believe? 

Something that is an absolute fact is, I really don’t know either one of 
these individuals. 

They are just personas put out for me on various viewing screens. I’m 
suppose to pick one of these people to make decisions on my behalf that 
will impact my life? 

The whole thing is actually quite ABSURD!!!

“Democracy” is one big dumb CULT!"
1176,1,"Good Luck America. I hope whatever happens will be the best for the 
country. I personally would vote against Trump, not because Clinton is good 
but because Trump is worse in my Opinion. I hope you will Vote, think 
before you vote and vote not only for your advantages but for the 
advantages of the whole United States and the rest of the World since this 
election does not only effect America . ( I guess i'm gonna get criticised 
for hoping for the best, since I have been before by Trumps supporters if 
not commenting 100% positive or against Trump)"

1183,3,"Dear Americans. The world is laughing at your stupidity. Nobody outside of 
the US will have any sympathy for you later on down the line. Brainless 
country."
1184,3,"Trump won the debate at 20:10. Couldve dropped the mic and walked off stage 
after that and still wouldve won"
1185,3,"People have a bad look at Trump because the media smeared him. Where was 
his evil all these years when the world knew him, including all these women 
he suppose abused so badly. Once he gets elected president - which I 
believe so - people will have the same view they had until now."
1186,1,I'll gladly vote a dead gorilla as president than these two cretins.

He is a racist, a big charlatan, and sexual predator, and the republican 
leaders are just idiots."

question, it was about if he thought he was a good influence or role model 
to children and he started talking about american law and order and change"

Clinton seems to be a better candidate, don't destroy your country."
1207,3,"Let's be clear : all the politicians lie. It's their job. But in addition 
to being a liar, uncle Donald is a creepy person with dirty opinions. Make

of the german history. And if you don't know what I am talking about and if 
you don't know what terrible things happend there, then you should rlly go 
check that. Then you can think about if you still like Trump again."

more time to talk than trump at some parts."
1219,3,"Trump is just looking for power and for money and he will lie about 
everything and acuse anybody if he has to."
1220,1,"I'm only 16 so I can't vote yet. However, if I was to I'd definitely vote 
for Trump. He seems to be more peaceful and easy - going, and has tried to 
avoid getting into scandals recently. However, Clinton has still not 
responded to 50% of the crimes she's committed. Not saying Trump is 
innocent, but he seems to not be spouting out propaganda bs like Clinton to 
brainwash her supporters. Triggered SJWS who think abortion is OK, feel 
free to reply"
1221,1,"I'm an Indian and this is none of my concern but still I would like to put 
up my view point that after hearing them both I feel sad for Americans, 
both are huge liars and trying very hard to convince you people to vote, 
Hillary Clinton is just a little less of an evil. 
I wish you guys could have Obama back."
1222,3,"Trump and his doctrine of hate, racism, bigotry, and hypocrisy are not good 
for anybody. He is corrupting peoples mind, just lying, fearmongering, and 
deceiving the fools."
1223,3,"Trump may have lots of money, but he is an idiot, an ignorant, and a big 
liar sorrounded by racist, bigots and evil people just like himself."
1224,3,"WOMEN WERE PAYING MORE before ObamaCare??? WHY!!! Again in a patriarchial

1225,2,go trump
1226,3,she won this and will win tonight!
1227,3,What's isis got to do with him being a rapist
1228,3,"We are fuked! That trump is nothing but a big fraud and a man full of lies 
and hate."
1229,3,"would any young ladies out there like a bill clinton cigar treat...don't 
worry ...hillary wont mind...or would you prefer some trump octopus 
hands...i hear hillary talking about what trump does to women...just ask 
yoko ono what hillary does to women...america had better wake up 
NOW...neither of these can become president and you know it..."
1230,3,"Probably the most disgusting human being for president in the history of 
human kind."
1231,3,no I'm sad Hilary lost😧😧😧
1232,3,"HILLARY FOR PRESIDENT! I don't see how there's even any kind of choice 
involved: it's either an experienced, intelligent human being for president 
or a moronic, appalling disgrace!"
1233,3,"Wow. I've been researching Hillary a lot lately and while I do deeply 
believe in her good side, I must say that after just recently having looked 
into the rape case Donald mentions here in which she indeed successfully 
defended a rapist and got him off the hook although she knew that he was 
guilty, I find that to be the most important and convincing reason to speak 
against her as a person and most importantly speaks against her as being a 
politician. I'm not saying there isn't enough that speaks against the same 
things in Trump's case. 
But standing there and calling him out on something he's supposed to 
apologise for (he definitely is!) while at the same time not having the 
mere guts to apologise to the rape victim is just such a low of character, 
I don't have any words for that.
I may not be an American citizen so I don't actually have a say in that but 
as a human being I am just sick and tired of this kind of politicians. 
Pointing fingers at everyone for their misbehaviours instead of standing up 
straight, trying to be a good person, being moral and saying when they're 
wrong, admitting to their mistakes and first and foremost BEING HONEST. 
That's what a strong leader is for me. It's one who is truthful and real 
and upright."
1234,1,"VOTE HILLARY!!!! Raise minimum wages, expand Obama-care, first female US 
President and THERMO-NUCLEAR WAR WITH RUSSIA!!! YEAH!!!"
1235,3,"I have a serious question, can anyone that is a Trump supporter please 
explain to me how you take him seriously?"
1236,0,"Side note: As a Brit looking at America from the outside the rise of Donald 
Trump is shocking. He wants tax cuts for the very rich, he is clearly anti 
hispanic, has clear contempt for women and minorities, loathes the 
President and loves Putin and Russia.

He has no clear policies, lies constantly, talks like a child, has a quick 
temper, cannot take criticism, holds a grudge, is revengeful, spiteful , 
narcissitic and aggressive.................and yet this race is 
competitive. If character means anythng to Americans it should not be.

Hillary Clinton is not without her flaws but in every area as shown in this 
debate she is superior to Donald Trump.

Do the right thing America................elect Hillary Clinton as your 
President. 

PS:The fact she is a woman is an added bonus.."
1237,3,"Why arm the kurds .-. giving guns to a foreign country for the sole purpose 
of making things right is nonsense. Not to even mention the american people 
paying taxes to light up conflict they don't even understand. Is it another 
ruse to get cheaper oil ? Go build hospitals and schools instead."
1238,3,"What an Idiot!!! If he will be elect, US are the stupiest Nation on Earth.
 P.S. :Now they are!!!"
1239,3,"Are you ready to get nuked, americans? Well you better be, fucktards. 
Saythanks to Nuland. Never forget. Never forgive. From Russia with love."
1240,3,"TRUMP IS MORE HUMBLED ON THIS DEBATE ..THAN ON THE 1ST DEBATE... MAYBE 
BECAUSE IN THIS SECOND DEBATE TRUMP WAS DEBATING IN FRONT OF A WHITE MAN 
AND WHITE WOMAN..... ON THE FIRST DEBATE ..THE DEBATE WAS IN FRONT OF ONLY 
ONE  BLACK MAN AND HE SHOWED VERY LITTLE RESPECT! HE WOULDN'T EVEN SHUT UP 
WHEN TOLD HIS TIME WAS UP...BUT ON THIS DEBATE THEY MADE BOTH OF THEM HUSH 
UP.."
1241,3,Voted for Hillary today
1242,3,"Trump is an idiot, a racist, a sexual predator and a very digusting human 
being. This time we have gone too far and too low now."
1243,3,"Americans if President Clinton, it will be a war in the world, she was sick 
in the head, in Ukraine now there is a war, thanks to America its power in 
Ukraine war gave Obama, Russia is not the aggressor, it is not not attack 
anyone, it's all Obama does that the circle is a war, make the right 
choice, only Trump will be peace in the world"

better president. I realize, America its not the same anymore. At the same 
time, they always gone do a lot of things then they don't do it."
1250,3,"Trump I am from Kuwait and so far you are really annoying the hell out of 
me I am not an American but dude you really oughta actually do your 
research cause not all of us are terrorists only 5/100000000000 are

future, who the hell can say anything else?! Hillary as a woman has a 
better perspective. For Hillary!!"
1252,3,"Finaly we got the sexual predator and the racist we a have always been 
dreaming of! I guess we all can say that justice has been done."
1253,3,"as hes looking in the camera at 10:25 his eyes get bigger and bigger and 
darker, its so demonic .."
1254,1,Batman will vote for Martha.
1255,3,I want hillary clinton to win
1256,3,"Hillary would be a better president. She is smartly kind. even her husband 
was a president of the USA for 8 years, not even a single racism or 
division occurred. Therefore she is trustworthy. BTW, she killed Bin-ladin 
and Qaddafi for a purpose, it is because both of them caused alot of 
corruption on land and both of them killed millions of innocent lives. 
Hillary, always hillary is better choice"
1257,3,"I hate Hillary Clinton , she has a huge head like a lion.
Her head is too big for her tiny old grandmother body.
@ 2:54 she doesn't have the look of a president she looks like an old 
grandmother
(I know that she is a grandmother) she's an old woman who is trying to act 
like a younger woman but it isn't working because she looks ridiculous.
Obama, has the look of a president , I think. 
Hillary doesn't , Trump doesn't either.
Why don't they set an age limit for being president , that way it will stop 
senior citizens like Trump and Hillary from trying to be president.
@ 3:43 Trump doesn't even know how to hold a microphone correctly."
1258,3,trump won legaly?
1259,3,"OMG
I live in Germany and i am so scared about Trump!! He said so Bad things 
Wtf !!! Why did YOU choose him?? Im very scared and my family too. Sorry 
for Bad english.😁😩"
1260,0,"20:10 ""It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald 
Trump is not in charge of the law in this country."" LMAO. Open mouth, 
insert foot."
1261,3,"Whats wrong with the Americans those two kandidates are a HUGE step back 
compared to Obama
And by the way they are both very unsympathetic ^^"
1262,1,"Do you think Hillary Clinton should've won this sign this petition that can 
push the electoral collage vote and go with the popular vote and on 
December 19 we can push this dude outta here link down below

"
1263,3,"yo trump, I would like you but you want to block me from tacos"
1264,3,"Why isnt this political debate about politics? We're focusing on who's a 
better person when we should be focusing on laws and projects.I mean its 
just weird , they bring each other down and try to show their adversary is 
more evil. What the heellll is thhhatt"
1265,3,"It was disgraceful of Hillary to call Trump a racist for daring to question 
the legitimacy of Obama's birth certificate. What did race have to do with 
that?"
1266,2,"Trump roasted Hillary, every single response."
1267,3,14:47 A fly lands on Hillary's face because flies like bullshit.
1268,3,"""Cause you'd be in jail."""
1269,2,The reported/host seems like she hates Donal trump
1270,3,1:24:50 is where Ken Bone is thank me later
1271,3,The Moderator is biased
1272,3,"1:29:38 - That guy really put Trump and Clinton on the spot with that 
question. Dude, you are the debate's real MVP."
1273,3,"""BECAUSE YOU'D BE IN JAIL"" *Mic drop*"
1274,3,"anyone else came here just to read all the comments saying trump will never 
win? haha"
1275,3,I enjoy watching these now that he's won. Killed it on the 2 last debates
1276,0,I VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP
1277,0,"I really do not like donald trump.. I hate him, but every time trump wants 
to respond to clinton this stupid blog bitch is interrupting him. This is 
not fair.."
1278,3,That fly that landed on Hilary is doing the fly nation proud..
1279,3,"I feel like Trump and Hilary are two divorced parents fighting over custody 
of us, but we kinda just wana go live with grandma."
1280,3,"from the first moment Hillary started talking I felt like I'm watching a 
movie with a usual pretentious wannabe."
1281,3,"Hillary looked SO smug throughout the campaign... How embarrassed must she 
be now?"
1282,3,"Do you think Russia is the problem? Russia is not the issue here. Terrorism 
is! Frankly, that is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. War kills, people 
have to die. But to stop this war, more people will die. It's a simple 
fact. People die! And they will continue to die, but those people are dying 
for the greater good of humanity. If Russia didn't bomb Syria then ISIS 
would have even more power. Does anyone want that?"
1283,3,Anderson is very biased. The woman moderator is worse.
1284,3,"Can Hillary stop saying ""America is Great because America is Good"" has she 
no idea how retarded that sounds?"
1285,3,"Trump ate this ""B"" for lunch. She is such a liar (and a bad one)."
1286,3,"Everyone loves Clinton when she speaks. Why? Because when she speaks she 
talks about things everyone would agree with.

""We are going to empower everyone"". ""We are going to fight against Cancer."" 
""We are going to help the middle class"" 

She is a politician. She says broad statements that any normal person would 
agree with. 


Trump is unpopular because he speaks the truth. A lot of people don't want 
to hear the truth. It sometimes is unpleasant. But that whats makes Trump 
such a winner, and a true leader- willing to do the right thing, even if 
its very unpopular."
1287,3,"Trump scares me, but Hillary's fake smiles scare me just as much, good luck 
America (o_O)\

1290,3,I would rather have Obama for another 4 years
1291,3,"TRUMPS WINNING, LIBERAL TEARS"
1292,3,14:49 there's a fly that lands on Hillary Clinton's face right..?
1293,3,"Isn't there 300,000,000 Americans?
And these are the best 2? :/"
1294,3,Hillary's poll numbers are dropping faster than her husband's pants!
1295,3,"I can see many Hillary supporters in the comments, well I have a question 
for you people, how would you feel if ww3 started, she openly said that on 
tv, that she want war with Russia, how do you feel right now, that maybe 
next year, a nuke will be dropped on New York, Washington DC, Los Angeles, 
not only american cities of course, Moscow, Berlin, Belgrade, Paris, how do 
you feel about that?"
1296,0,"Donald Trump is better than Hillary Clinton, I'm listening both of them, 
Donald Trump open man"

people happy."
1301,0,i predict Donald trump wins
1302,3,"I thank God Trump won. Hillary would have brought total destruction to the 
USA."
1303,3,"I love how when Trump speaks when he's not supposed to or goes over his 
response time the moderators dont shut up just going ""Mr Trump!"" Over and 
over but when Hillary does it its one ""Secretary Clinton"" like every 10 
seconds"
1304,0,"Anyone with a brain can see that Donald makes zero sense during his 
speeches, often gliding away from the topic.
Likewise, none of his many words are backed by fact. From the looks of 
FactCheck.org, investigators usually debunk his statements with 
kindergarten ease.
Yet, Trump makes a lot of noise and gives the illusion that he’s 
ahead of the game. It confuses his supporters as well as his opponents.

1305,3,to be honest i only watched this because of SNL
1306,1,"Simple question. Would you vote for Laura Bush? Barbara Bush? Nancy Reagan? 
Rosalynn Carter? Pat Nixon? Mamie Eisenhower? Mary Lincoln? Martha 
Washington? Why would anyone vote for an ex-President's wife to become 
President? All nice people in their own way but it doesn't qualify them to 
run for President. Hillary Clinton running for President is beyond 
ridiculous. The only Countries where wives of a former National leader 
""take over"" are monarchies, dictatorships or banana republics. America is a 
republic. Even voting for Hillary Clinton will classify the US as a 
dictatorship or a banana republic."
1307,3,"It´s unbelieveble how much more mature Hilary is than Donald. He really has 
to work on his anger issues, so immature....."
1308,3,So what does JayZ and his ilk mean when they insult women?
1309,2,hahaha Trump is owning
1310,3,MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!!!!
1311,2,"mr.trump did you abuse women ?
Trump:yes, I will get rid of the IS and help America
🤓"
1312,3,was there a fly in the debate!? or is this just me
1313,3,"""Cause you'd be in jail"" hahaha"
1314,3,"I want Hillary to win. I am anti-american. World needs WWIII. USA needs to 
be broken up or at least weakened (along with their Islamic attack dogs), 
if world peace is to be achieved. As a person who actually understands 
geopolitics and history, there is no other way.
World should gear up and support Russia. China isn't fit for this job. Like 
it or not, USA is destined to go down. Traction gained by Bernie Sanders is 
proof that USA is a sunset empire. The world can either choose to go down 
with it, or prepare for the new sun.
Yes, even with Trump, USA will go down. But he won't lead the world to 
WWIII, which would mean USA may live to fight another day(meaning century). 
USA can't be left alive."
1315,3,Those news hosts were biased towards Clinton.
1316,3,"can he stop breathing so hard into the microphone and interrupting in a 
debate? Wow! Why keep making childish remarks? This is ridiculous... he is 
making my IQ drop...."
1317,3,Am I the only one who saw that fly on hillary's face?
1318,3,I'm here to get into the bone zone.
1319,3,Ken Bone 1:24:47
1320,0,Donald trump roasted her ass 🔥
1321,0,"Shout out to all Non Americans who are watching the US Debates just to see 
Donald Trump get humiliated by a girl."
1322,3,"America is NOT great it hasnt been great since the bushes and clintons made 
it a disgrace Its a shame because america was the country everyone wanted 
to be like but now it is hated over the world. Hilary has been intimidating 
women for her husband for years Bill Clinton raped and sexually assaulted. 
Trump is right in what he is saying the clintons are the biggest predators 
also look at what trump said 11 years ago is it really that big a deal when 
you see whats going on in the world, Hillary just said when they go low you 
go high then she went even lower she is a witch and not just as a 
description she is a true witch she does not believe in God she is a 
wiccan, she is more disgusting than Trump"
1323,3,was that a fly on her face at 14:55?? lmao she is lying
1324,3,"I'm not even American but a black African, I would advise Americans to vote 
for Donald than Hilary because she's selfish, greedy and a murder! people 
are so blinded by racism and feminism and all that but is that the main 
problem? and Hilary as a woman is racist and only cares about her pocket 
everyhing she says is for show! as she claims she has two personality..this 
is on camera...If Hilary Clinton becomes the next president, it's the of 
America ...and the world I be honest, she wants WW3 like its a joke...coz 
that would destroy humanity and existence...PEACE, may God guide you"
1325,3,the sun creats enough energy to power the world for a year in 50 minutes
1326,1,are Americans that stupid? why would any of you vote for Trump?
1327,3,Either way I'll have a show to watch when one of them become president. :]
1328,3,clinton all the way <3
1329,3,"disgusting martha ratshit starts debating trump !!??...right !...no media 
bias here..."
1330,3,"Thank god I'm European, although a lot of our politicians are just as bad 
but my main concern is I don't think either of these candidates are up to 
the job of president, I can't see Trump being the diplomatic president, he 
opened a golf course in Scotland and because a man wouldn't move his home 
he insulted him built a fence around his property and tried to bill him for 
it.
Clinton does not come over as a strong personality the president has to 
show strength and intelligence a firm but fair personality, Clinton does 
not show that."
1331,3,For some reason I ship Hilary and Trump. Trumilary RULES
1332,3,"Ya so I ordered a flight to canada for November 8 just in case trump wins. 
oh and they should have sponsored the debate by air Canada"
1333,3,"While I'm no fan of Hillary, I got sick of hearing her talk. I don't belive 
she will effectively get rid of ISIS ASAP. All talk. Not that I trust Trump 
anymore but with all this terrorism we need someone to deliver the hard 
blows."
1334,3,"Hillary has discussed the e-mails and everything else, but he avoids all 
the dirty, dirty questions addresses to him. ANSWER! You have five days, 
Trump. CLINTON FOR PRESIDENT!"
1335,3,"I don't need to apologize for talking about sexually assaulting women but 
damn it Hillary you better apologize for a private server."
1336,2,trump is dumb
1337,0,When in the video did Donald trump say Hilary should be in jail?
1338,3,"Trump is a criminal, a sexual predator, a racist, and a big crook."
1339,3,"keep Hilary for culture and development.. keep trump for security. I hate 
both of them though"
1340,3,"Donald has some truth cause he knows how bad she is but he is no better so 
no America pick your doom D.T or H.C you either vote for a racist psycho 
that hates Muslims and Mexicans or you go for Hilary who caused the leakage 
of government secrets cause she was lazy enough not to use the encrypted 
email and many people that try to sue her or tell the truth about her are 
either dead or murdered and now all of America is going to experience 
ARMAGEDDON
oh and each time a question is asked to either of them they talk minutes of 
bullshit which translates to 4 words"" we're gonna fix it"""
1341,2,HI. TRUMP IS A RAPIST!

about to start lol"

president."
1350,3,omfg just realized that she isn't technically the nominee
1351,2,TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP
1352,0,13:10-14:40 Donald Trump trapped Hillary Clinton in a corner.

bad things about Trump and say I'll never vote for him... BUT are now on 
Trumps side"""
1357,3,Hillary 2016
1358,3,"So ""Make America Great Again"" well America would be the first country to 
lose all of their allies, and Clinton will loose her own country men and 
women's trust. America is a country truly a country to look up to 
(sarcastically speaking)."
1359,3,"when result of this elections come ,anybody knows ?"
1360,3,😒😒😒😒😒😒 BILL CLITON ISN'T RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT
1361,3,I am American girl I hope Hillary win 🙏

agree with that but it depends on how you see it."
1363,3,wtf he said that straight in front of bill Clinton??? hahahahahahahhaha
1364,3,SHE GOT SCHLONGED !
1365,3,"She Came, She Lost, We Laughed"
1366,3,I'm glad Trump got the last laugh on these despicable libtards
1367,2,Trump crushed Hillary
1368,3,"If Hillary gets elected, I'm moving to Switzerland."
1369,3,"Where's Negan, with Lucille when you need'm?"
1370,3,"A big fat fly landed on the White of Clintons top,  at 1:24:05 I thought it 
was a tiny bug on my i phone screen."
1371,3,"The people who voted for Trump and Hillary are the same people who cried 
over a Gorilla for 6 months"
1372,3,you won the coin toss so u go first oh so professional lol 😂😂😂
1373,3,"Donald allowed them to attack him 3 times on the video and then he took the 
gloves off and kept them off for the rest of the debate. Now America will 
find out who Jon Podesta is and the involvement of Hillary / Bill in the 
Jeffery Epstein Island . The flight manifest shows 26 trips by Bill to that 
Island and 6 for Hillary. What will the people say then? What will they say 
about the satanic cult Hillary is active in? What will they say when they 
find out about the children who were kidnapped and flown to that island , 
tortured , raped , and then sacrificed . What will people say when they 
find out that the ocean that surrounds that island is a shark infested 
child grave yard?
Julian Assange is releasing this data now... Not even the mainstream media 
will be able to stop it now. This data was not given to wikileaks by the 
Russians, It was given by a group of patriots that still exist within our 
own intelligence community who have been working directly with Julian 
Assange. This information will spread like a aggressive cancer for all the 
world to see. Perhaps then , the people will see that America just dodged a 
bullet aimed straight at their hearts!"
1374,3,"This was the dirtiest, most biased, one-sided debate I've ever watched."
1375,3,Snake face got owned! Trump is our new emperor 😊
1376,2,Trump will go after her once he is in office. She is such a liar!
1377,3,"Trump is a big mistake and the wrong way. No racist and no women abuser can 
be good president. Trump is also a big charlatan and a big crook."
1378,3,she had the questions before hand. It's been proven.
1379,3,3 vs 1
1380,3,"omg wt lies she says wow
lol i cant beleave it omg"
1381,3,They're still counting the votes on THE CLINTON NEWS NETWORK...... haha!!
1382,3,"Nope. Hillary also saw the questions. CNN should never be allowed to host 
or even participate in a debate ever again."
1383,3,"Trump is at least talking practically, logically, arguing with some valid 
points. HC is just seen talking about values and feelings all the time and 
using the age old its-the-russians excuse. Her lie was kind of evident when 
she attacked wikileaks. I even sense her smile is fake. You really think if 
US destroys syrian homes and lets syrians in, they will not annex the US 
from inside at some point , and will embrace with open arms to help US 
attack middle east again for the oil ?"
1384,3,is the best of America feeling better today?
1385,3,"hillary spoke pretty fast at first,but she soon got tired,she doesnt have 
the energy for any tough job anymore.well done AMERICA,you've made the 
right choise."
1386,3,"In her first sentence this woman lied, saying ""Only we have seen the 
questions."""
1387,3,Trump won the debate big league
1388,3,"God, that announcer lady is so annoying and her voice sounds like she wants 
to cry."
1389,3,"Blatant lies. The questions were developed in collusion with Hilary's 
campaign. Wikileaks proved it. Can't trust any alphabet media anymore."
1390,3,The main reason she lost is the guy that sits in the Oval Office.
1391,3,happened on my #21 birthday..
1392,3,"The way that Clinton talks as if you are a small child, and that fake 
laugh, is what makes me think that it was all an act. These people are 
truly not there for the people, they only need them for the votes and after 
that you are out of luck."
1393,3,"15:15 crowd clapped for Hillary, moderator didn't tell them not to, 
interesting, meanwhile 3 seconds prior the crowd clapped for Trump they say 
don't"
1394,3,"oh god this trash is killing me, why do i poison myself?"
1395,3,"Are these two delusional about changing things for the better, or are they 
lying to the people naive enough to believe them?"
1396,3,I can't believe she brought up Mohammed Ali.
1397,3,"i voted for trump because hes a straight up honest man.. unlike the crook 
who cant hop off the bus talk and stick to politics"
1398,3,"18:40 That animal wasn't smiling on November 9th! 20:13 What a comeback 
line!!!"
1399,3,"@24:18

Sums up Hillarys/Democrats entire attitude during the entire elections, how 
wrong they were, the only thing falling apart right now is the democratic 
party."
1400,3,"Lol just funny the way he keeps dodging Anderson's insistent questions 
about sexual assault. Yes, I have certainly seen his great respect for 
women😢"
1401,3,😆😆☺😊😀😁😃😄😅😮😴😢
1402,3,"Notice how she keeps standing in front of him? The media attempted to 
portray this as him stalking her, it clearly was her moving across the 
stage and crowding him out. I suspect this was a deliberate strategy."
1403,3,"18:46 I hope he actually gets a special prosecutor to take care of Hillary. 
She needs to pay for her crimes!"
1404,3,"They are litteraly not fully answering the questions and just have to make 
it sooo long by saying what they want to do instead to the country."
1405,3,"She made the mistake of thinking people wanted to hear plans and 
implementation schemes. Basically if you can't be trusted you can talk all 
day and the outcome is still you can't be trusted. And she has the track 
record in politics, so America rolled the dice."
1406,3,When you already know the questions and still get destroyed xD
1407,3,"Hillary calling Donald out on doubting that Obama was born in America, yet 
it was her campaign that started that entire birth thing back in 2008... 
This woman will say anything."
1408,3,THE FLY was attracted Hillsh.t

FROM BACKSTAGE GRABBED THE PAGES INSTANTLY."
1417,3,These are even better the second time around 😩
1418,3,"Lier CCN woman saaying she is the ONLY ONE who has seen the questions.

1421,3,our country is really great because it is good.
1422,3,"That first question was proof that Hilary had seen them in advance. She 
said "" are you a teacher"" bate."
1423,3,On my WEDDING in 2017 the turnout will be 100 per cent.
1424,3,my favorite debate.....craziness
1425,3,"only found out the questions and no one knows they should be ashamed 
Anderson and that woman"
1426,3,"Mrs Clinton spoke just like a politician!... anything she spoke with a 
tongue like a propaganda staff... people nowadays are sick of that..."
1427,3,"it's funny how when the audience applauds hillary at min 15 the moderators 
dont say anything, but when trump reks hillary at min 21 they are all like: 
please stop applauding it damages the show :)) nothing to see here guys, no 
bias at all!"

1436,3,Серьёзно...?
1437,3,"I'm so glad that my sister, is president. ""Because you'd be in jail"""

asked.... half an hour in the video and 1 question was correctly 
answered....."
1439,3,if you hate trump subscribe to me if you hate hillary subscribe to me
1440,3,"Hillary went round one with Putin...ha, ha!"
1441,3,"That last question was a brilliant armor-piercing question. This debate was 
a circus; little more than a 90 minute argument that the moderators came 
within a few octaves of losing control over it. And then along comes this 
guy, who wants to know one thing that they admire about each other. Just 
brilliant."
1442,0,"Don't forget to watch the exclusive clip of Hillary and Donald singing 
''Breaking Free'' on my channel!"
1443,3,I laughed so hard during this debate
1444,3,how the hell do you read 39 thousand emails

1452,3,"booom bitch, get out da way. lol"
1453,3,"Hillary 2016 ""we are great because we are good"""
1454,3,"if this election were to be held in Africa, i would have said it is 
rig.......but big America voted for a person who talk nothing but attack on 
her colleaques without making sense"
1455,3,"I never watched these debates until now , I would of voted for trump he's 
so honest Hilary sound so scripted and only cares about attaching trump at 
every beginning of her arguments. She lies to much. She doesn't care about 
us just are votes. Watch her disappear if she wins."
1456,3,Anderson Cooper is gay
1457,3,"syria... has anybody seen the movie scarface? the whole bit about the cuban 
crime wave? that's exactly what will happen if we let them in. there will 
be hard working honest innocent people like tony montana's sister and his 
mother BUT PEOPLE LIKE TONY MONTANA WILL ALSO BE MIXED IN AMONG THEM! it's 
sad and little kids being bombed breaks my heart but there's no need to 
sacrifice the safety of the american people. there are other ways to help 
them."
1458,3,"Terrorists backed by housein Obama brought the war in Syria they are 
responsible for the disaster NOT RUSSIAN AIRFORCE YOU blond SCUMBAG"
1459,2,"You do not deserve that trump
Fine,.ok"
1460,3,"every time hillary brings up a topic that Trump doesn't want to talk about 
he turns it around on her and completely changes the subject that has 
nothing to do with the original topic of what he did wrong."
1461,0,Donald Trump is the best man in the usa
1462,3,This bitch at the desk looks like a witch

1466,3,"I love watching this through the lens of her devastating, embarrassing, 
deserved loss. She is, was and will forever be a LIAR. Buh-BYE!!!!!!"
1467,3,"Trump`s finest hour this. To come into this debate from such a position of 
weakness and within 10 or so minutes turn defence into attack was seriously 
impressive. Clinton`s constant fake smile told you everything, she couldnt 
believe what was happening and I think it dawned on her that she had 
underestimated her opponent. This was the day the momentum really switched 
towards Trump."
1468,3,Hilary got destroyed hahahaha
1469,3,"14:36 that look she gives the audience means stfu or you'll ""commit 
suicide"" next"

1471,3,"""Tell me something you respect about your opponent""
Hillary: I like his kids
Trump: I admire her will to fight
Here we can see that she just hates him for no reason."
1472,3,"Trump took the high road in response to the last question.  He gave Hillary 
a compliment.  She took the low road and complimented his kids."
1473,3,"God Trump is your new President now ! ♥
*Go look at the video on my channel where Ann Coulter was laughed at when 
she said Trump will win (If you want to of course)*"
1474,3,"trump is roasting hillary she really doesnt know what shes talking about im 
really happy to see mr trump as our president"
1475,3,She knew that women was a teacher
1476,3,"I am soo happy, that Hillary is not the next president of the USA.
But I am not overhasty: Let see how D. Trump is acting.
Maybe he will be bent up by the US-regime or when he'll not do what they 
wand he will maybe end like JF Kennedy.
Let see what the future will bring, I am optimistic, because of that the 
Killary Lady is not the next president. But the future is not written, we 
will see how it will be.
I hope D. Trump will kick all those bastards out the government and media, 
that work against the own population."
1477,3,"Should have voted for Cunton. Ya'll gonna' starve when that gatorade hits 
the crops."
1478,3,"Even if you do not like him Trump is the man for the job not hillary that's 
why he got elected. Hillary has been in business for 30 years and look 
where we are, nowhere."

1480,3,"When she smiles while Donald is attacking her i feel like the devil is in 
her. She looks like Satan and thank god She's never going to be President"

1487,3,NOW HE IS OUR PRESIDENT !!! GO TRUMP!!!! YOU DID IT 👍🏻👍🏻
1488,3,this is HILLARYous😂😂😂😂
1489,3,"The way I see it, Trump isn't interested in fighting wars against any 
country. He would rather do business, make new friendships, strengthen 
existing friendships and improve financial cooperation with all in any way 
he can. He looks at the world through the eyes of a successful businessman, 
who also happens to care for his people, and who wants to improve their 
lives. So, grandma, it' time you went home and fed your cats. Let serious 
people do serious, responsible jobs."

wrong doing by CIA, HRC causes a War, knowingly provided arms to ISIS via 
Saudi Arabia, Rigs the DNC, gets off with a slap on the wrist.

Trump ain't perfect, but he better follow through on this"
1497,3,"if i was an american i would have shot myself while hearing such a pathetic 
illiterate debate."

moderators and the questions for sure killary knew he defeat 91% corrupt 
media he defeat the Clinton machine and their corruption he defeat the odds

and easy to let go at list for me and it was a personal or family situation 
but Benghazi it's us.Also i like to congratulate Trump and i hope his 
taking America much much serious then he appear and bring America back cas 
it's a disaster and for me personally i didn't have a president for 8 
years, sad to say but yes I felt that way."

glad he brought up Bill and his scandals and how Hillary basically cleared 
him. He should have mentioned how she blackmailed a woman bill was having 
an affair with who worked at the White House as well.. Just a shame that 
trump himself has sexual allegations and was happy to play golf with Bill, 
for Hillary and Bill to attend his wedding(S) and that trump and Hillary go 
way back, to the 60s. But Hillary had way too much censorship and 
protection. Warmongering scum bag"

1683,3,"- 14:32    Moderators immediately quiet people cheering about what Trump 
said.        -15:16 Nothing is said when the Hilldawg fans cheer about what 
she said.            you guys, Trump may have a point about this rigged 
system. If you actually look into who funds her, you can see what he 
means. Donald is shaking their nest and you can see republicans and 
democrats coming out against him like little rats getting their home torn 
apart, because evil doesn't pick a party. Its funny though, the workers of 
this nation support him, for example the over 15,000 border patrolmen who 
agree that the illegal immigration is an epidemic. Check the facts. Don't 
just vote against Trump because that's what CNN and SNL tell you to do."
1684,3,"Wow, I love the part when Donald was lowkey dissing President Clinton and 
he was just in the audience like ""This bish did not"""
1685,3,"Gee, he wants to lower corporate taxes and get rid of regulations. Could 
this possibly be to benefit him?"

one this time that in all porn movies made there they must wear condoms or 
not. Now Bill Clinton has bonked several hundred Democrat women and has

1700,3,"After watching the 1st 20 minutes of this, im reminded of a very informed

""Their personalities are more informantive than recarnating milk in a 
mothers womb. There is more of a chance of becoming an elepthesis, or 
becomimg a patrametis. Now, there may be some people in this world who can 
recarnate.""
The quote was then interupted by a caller on his radio show, but i think 
that quote is very fitting here regarding these two."

1718,3,"I wonder how many more people Donald could employ by halting all foreign 
business, and using American workers for every step of his financial 
success. The whole reason for the sliding economy is because so many 
companies choose lower taxes, less, or no environmental protection, and 
few regulations. Why is China broke? Why is America broke? Because all the 
rich people in both countries are just using the working people."

rampant.

Since it speaks to the hearts of these workers and the unemployed, Trump - 
unlike Republicans - does not want to cut health and pension costs of 
public assistance: many Republican voters, out of work, 65 years in need of 
Social Security (retirement pension ) and Medicare (health care, minimum, 
of the poor) expanded by Obama. He promised the reduction of drug prices, 
and proposed the reduction of a federal tax that affects 73 million 
low-income families.

On the other hand, it will increase the tax burden - swore - suitraders

But that lying witch her campaign is being sponsored by a muslim and she 
wore a mulsimkerchief on her head for that muslim and THAT is the most 
DISRESPECTFUL thing towards women in the entire world. She accepts help 
from the religion that is utmost disrespectful towards women and do not say 
this is not true, because it is true. Women are like slaves towards their 
husbands, muslims can have multiple women, they can beat their women, their 
women have to cover themselves up when going in public, they have less 
rights and they ALWAYS have to obey their husbands.

Rape is something very common in the islam, why do you think there are so 
many European women and girls getting raped? Because in the eyes of 
muslims, women are inferior and they treat our women the same way as they 
treat their own women, which results in so much rape and not even half of 
all the rapes are reported.

Islam MUST BE driven out of Europe and America. Not even 20% of the entire 
world population is white so stop the race-mixing by accepting 
multiculturalism. Multiculturalism does not work, multiple cultures 
together does not work, there will always be problems when there is 
multiculturalism. It destroys the unique ancient cultures of Europe, it is 
exterminating the white race.
We HAVE to stop this from happening."

1816,3,"Is Russia messing with our election in an effort to get Donald Trump into 
the White House?

The answer is yes.

Trump has repeatedly dismissed the possibility. ""She has no idea whether
it's Russia, China or anybody else,"" the Republican nominee said during
the final presidential debate when Hillary Clinton stated that Russian 
President Vladimir Putin was behind the hacking of Democratic National 
Committee emails. He added: ""Hillary, you have no idea.""
Clinton did have an idea -- the Democratic nominee was correct to point 
the finger at Russia. And Trump, who had received a 
classified briefing on the subject, knew it.
""The U.S. Intelligence Community is confident that the Russian 
Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons 
and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations,"" the 
Department of Homeland Security and the National Intelligence director's
office said in a statement the first week of October. They added:
""These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. 
election process.""
Now, less than a week before Election Day, it's becoming 
clear that Russia isn't satisfied with stealing and disseminating email 
from Democratic Party groups. It looks likely our former Cold War 
adversary is also creating counterfeit documents to support Trump's 
baseless claim that the election system is ""rigged"" against him.
""The FBI and U.S. intelligence agencies are examining faked 
documents aimed at discrediting the Hillary Clinton campaign as part of a
broader investigation into what U.S. officials believe has been an 
attempt by Russia to disrupt the presidential election,"" Reuters 
reported on Thursday.
Among the documents that are being examined, the news 
service wrote, is a fake letter from Delaware Sen. Tom Carper, a key 
member of the Senate's Homeland Security Committee. In the letter, he 
tells Clinton he will secure the election for her. Reuters added:
In addition to the Carper letter, the FBI has also 
reviewed a seven-page electronic document that carries the logos of 
Democratic pollster Joel Benenson's firm, the Benenson Strategy Group, 
and the Clinton Foundation, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
The document, identified as a fake by the Clinton 
campaign, claims poll ratings had plunged for Clinton and called for 
""severe strategy changes for November"" that could include ""staged civil 
unrest"" and ""radiological attack"" with dirty bombs to disrupt the vote.
Some fringe right websites have already heralded the fake 
documents, presenting them as legitimate. The possibility of a Russian 
disinformation campaign, with fraudulent documents mixed in with real 
ones, is one reason the Clinton campaign has not authenticated any of 
the DNC emails that the transparency site WikiLeaks has been releasing day 
by day."

clinton because he had that confidence,and again,there's also some 
unnecessary things that he shouldn't have said,because it can made some 
people really angry and that's also not a good thing,people might come up 
to him,who knows? anyway,no hate,it's just my little opinion,we all already 
know who wins so....i like pizza"

America is more interested in the jobs her, BJ Bill, Bush, and Obama are

minimum wage or lower and I still cannot afford health care if it wasn't 
for Obamacare. if you Republicans think that we Lower Class People are 
going to let you take away something like this you're out of your freaking

changes and want the same elite at the top, you vote for Clinton. And most 
importantly, don't make your choice based on the media, because the media 
is also controlled by this elite. The media has taken one side in this

we are fighting a campaign that concedes the reality of, ""[a]s a nation we

nationally"". The republican party has it's agenda based on, ""[w]e gotta 
save the country from those (""Stronger Together"") voters""; because they are 
causing a massive degree of harm to themselves...

While I thought it was great the entirety of the presidential election was 
here on YouTube, I have to say that when my closed captions were on, I was 
at a loss. Though I am hearing, there are 360 million people globally who 
rely on the usage of closed captioning. This debate's captioning didn't 
even begin until almost a half hour into the video's beginning (28 minutes, 
38 seconds to be exact) but started with statements that were not made at 
the start of the video. It would be wonderful if something so widely 
watched amongst hearing people could also be viewed by the millions who 
cannot hear but still are voters in our country.

rather than a moderator. Not to mention how hypocritical she was; She 
starts out by asking the audience not to interrupt, yet you see her 
interrupting threw out the debate, and even laughing at one point. What a 
mistake it was to cast her as a moderator! After watching her, it seems

2062,3,Killary = 3. WW
2063,3,"Never in the history of this country has there been a political race 
like this. It is a dark day in America when the media and our own 
government help to cover up all the lies, corruption and major 
disregard for the laws that Hillary Clinton has been shoving in our face 
doing anything she can to win this election. No matter how low it is or
how many laws she has to break do so. Hillary will stop at nothing 
including murder to get what she wants. I hope the Americans are smart 
enough to give her what she deserves, which is 30+ years in maximum 
security a Federal Penitentiary. Obama and Hillary are trying to destroy 
this country and its time the American people stand up and take it back."
2064,1,"If you want the US to go to nuclear war with Russia, vote for Hillary. If 
you want peace, vote for Trump."
2065,3,hillary clinton is a bitch and trump is our next president
2066,1,"This is the first time I have watched any presidential debate. Hillary, 
Donald, come over here for a moment. Donald I am not sure about you, you 
are bit rough on the edges but you seem like an honest person. Hillary, 
your husband said it all before you even became important. The fact that 
whole world listens to this instead of focusing on real issues proves a 
point. We have to get rid of dumbs somehow. So I would vote Hillary. JFK 
world does not deserve you so you had to go. Donald if people where honest 
and moral I'd vote you over other candidates but I think so would they 
then. But I am not even U.S. citizen so who cares."
2067,3,*Trump Won.*
2068,3,"https://soundcloud.com/user-593104302/dread-head check me out lol this is 
more relevant than whatever is going on in this video."
2069,1,"When you vote, ASK FOR A PAPER BALLOT!!!!! They LEGALLY have to give you 
one if you ask. TRUMP 2016!!!!! Drain the swamp of CORRUPTION"
2070,0,"I really don't agree with Donald Trump because he hates black people so I 
don't agree with his political methods"
2071,3,Jill Stein is killing 2 birds with 1 debate;)
2072,3,I think I puked at least once or twice in my mouth during this video
2073,3,Why does Martha look like a frog under a brick?
2074,3,"The votes this election for Trump will come from TRUMPUBLICANS. This group 
of people are evil or stupid or both. The republican party needs to get 
better or get voted out of any seat in public office. It is a very corrupt 
party. TRUMPUBLICANS is what voters in this election and every election in 
the future need to be reminded of. If any body reading this has access to 
the Democratic party and can make sure voters get this message especially 
in future election to help get back the house and secure the 
senate.TRUMPUBLICANS control the Republican party. Until all the 
republicans that supported trump to the end are no longer in this party 
they do not deserve a vote. I hope this can be a turning point in American 
politics. Where attack ads lose votes of the attackers. TRUPUBLICANS. Can 
some body get this to the Democrats? Reply if you can."
2075,3,Trump's last hope is to take Hillary furniture shopping:)
2076,3,"With these 2 dummies running for president, we're all doomed😒"

2083,0,I think Hilary and Donald are both a disaster. I miss Bernie
2084,3,"Two of the most bland people i've ever seen.. lost interest in politics 
after watching them go on about nothing"
2085,3,This guy will cause ww3 if he gets elected
2086,0,"Most of the time, Donald Trump has been making personal attacks a Hillary 
and diverting from the topic rather than actually providing relevant 
answers to the questions asked, during the debate. He's playing with the 
psychology of people (by playing the ""blame game"")."
2087,3,"His idea of running the country, is making himself look like he matters, 
making himself look like he is wanting to help the little people.or other 
races. He may help other races as long as they are wealthy. He is more 
unfit to run this country then the person we just had in office. We need 
someone who is going to genuinely care about every aspect of our security, 
our liberty, our posterity, our education. Not someone who just wants to be 
in the White house and take vacations, or let the house run the country. WE 
NEED SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO BE THERE FOR ALL OF US> NOT JUST THE WEALTHY."
2088,3,"the only way the election is rigged is that the media does the work infavor 
od hillary no doubt."
2089,3,"""When I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious!"" - Yeah, 
they're either furious with your inappropriate, shameless behavior or 
they're racist, just like you..."
2090,1,Alshammri city hail. Saudi I vote for trump. Goooooooood trump
2091,3,"Let's redo the whole election and get different candidates. They are both 
bad Trump will bring us to another recession and Clinton will take us to 
war with Russia not a great idea."
2092,2,"Trump may not be presidential material, but he would be infinitely less 
damaging to the U.S than Hillary..."
2093,1,"I wish erik harris and dylan klebold were still alive so i could vote for 
them real heroes."
2094,3,We are great because we are good??
2095,3,"I should not have watched the SNL sketches first, this is so painful to 
watch"
2096,3,"How did we go from being admired by the world to this....,time is up for 
US!"
2097,3,At the time of the war on Iraq didn't trump say hell yeah to it?
2098,1,"I see how everyone complains that they are both awful and I will agree 100%
If I was american I would just vote for a third party if you don't vote you 
make it worst"
2099,2,"TRUMP IS HILARIOUS, HILLARY IS TRIUMPH"
2100,0,"(Not a US citizen, just sharing my views after reading a lot about both of 
them) she is toooooo much of a politician! I don't support Donald trump. 
But Hillary is not a good person for the job, US is going to lose a lot of 
money in the coming years if she comes to the office. On the other hand, 
donald trumps hatred and need to earn money might just help. He seems to be 
out spoken which the US needs. US needs someone who will say that 'no i 
dont want to give you money' or 'no i am not going to let you buy my 
companies' (you know what i mean) 
Very very strange that I'm saying this but US needs a business man not a 
politician for the coming 8 years or even 4. 

One suggestion for the people who thinks donald trump is an idiot.
Read about him, watch his old videos and you will be surprised to see that 
he makes sense when he talks. He is not going to spend any money outside 
the US, forget about the nuclear weapons they cost way too much in 
comparison to what he thinks is expensive.

Rethink, who ever is supporting Hillary. This is all marketing, very easy 
manipulation. Dig more before you vote."
2101,3,"I'm British and the whole thing is like two children arguing over the same 
toy in the playground why don't they stop sniping their opponent and 
actually tell the people of America what THEM THEMSELVES will do if they 
are gave the opportunity to change their country for the greater good . 
What kind of things will Americans be looking for if they choose which ever 
candidate"
2102,3,WHEN THEY GO LOW YOU GO HIGH
2103,3,"Can someone please explain to me why they are just concentrating on putting 
each other down instead of presenting their own SOLUTIONS for problems of 
the country. Is it because the American people will choose the one who 
gives worse burns in a debate instead of the one who actually has better 
solutions for the USA's future?"
2104,3,"Trump started the campaign because he saw foolish things happen to America? 
Smh"
2105,0,"Really... where is your evidence that Donald Trump is buying the steel 
being dumped by the Chinese to build his houses, Clinton?!"
2106,3,"Mather Rusia loves Mister Trump. Big peace гцссэф no klinton she woman 
woman cooks cleans not president no smart baby yes married yes ok 
ppresjdent no. Pilot no. It's normal trump peace Klinton wuman"
2107,3,Do a paper ballot!!!!!!

fuss is about."
2115,2,Who votes for Trump??
2116,3,put her in jail
2117,3,"Blondie Moderator is so annoying. I feel like a good smack across the face 
would fix that speech impediment."
2118,3,"This was the strongest debate of Trump, I remember it well, it was a 
landslide, what a statement he made here."
2119,3,"1:58 ""our country really is great because it's good"" - Hillary Clinton 2016"
2120,3,Welp. Looks like im moving to Canada.
2121,3,This is literally people roasting each other in a polite matter wtaf.
2122,3,This is a joke. NBC is trash.
2123,3,Thank goodness I don't live in America now
2124,3,"Biggest difference between Hillary and Bernie? Bernie would have raised 
taxes to pay for healthcare (lowering premiums/deductibles) education 
(opening the possibilities to a better life) and infrastructure (roads, 
waterways, bridges, hospitals, schools). Hillary will raise taxes to 
continue foreign interventionist and imperialist wars."
2125,3,"I'm sorry Hillary Clinton but USA has a horrible National Health Service oh 
wait there is no NHS like we have in the UK, Portugal, Spain, France etc."
2126,3,"This two should have been in a Jerry Springer episode. You know, punching 
and kicking and clawing and kissing."
2127,3,the fight for white house are ugly lol bettween hilary and thrump
2128,3,"“However [political parties] may now and then answer popular ends, they are 
likely in the course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which 
cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the 
power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, 
destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust 
dominion.” - George Washington #Repubs #Dems"
2129,3,"How come that the first few questions were about personality but those 
questions were not directed to what count's but directed in a very subtle 
way to make Donald look bad. And by the way Killary was given the questions 
ahead of time."
2130,3,I thought this was the SNL one😂
2131,3,Bahaha Hillary complete dodged that first question 😂
2132,3,"Since this is nbc I figured there would be 100 ads, I guess not."
2133,3,This election is the worst reality show EVER
2134,3,14:50 a fly land on Hillary Clintons forehead
2135,3,"i cant believe one of them is going to be the precedent, as a part of an IT 
company if I ever get a chance to visit USA, i will definitely try to avoid 
it. I don't want to be in a country where first man or woman is someone 
like them :P"
2136,3,I feel sad for Hillary that she has to debate with a teenage
2137,3,jail jail to hillary cheating the 3 debates she speak 99 per cent liers.
2138,2,"what will you do about clowns ??
:trump put her in jail 
people OHHHHHHHHH"
2139,3,go to watch my trump.vs clinton debate rap battle
2140,3,OMG America is comdemned
2141,3,"I've seen more reasonable, logical, better constructed arguments in a 
primary school. They're just children with microphones, its just silly. And 
that American in the background is just plain rude to the audience, why 
don't they have manners? You cross an ocean to get to America from England 
and look how uncivilised and silly the world becomes in such a short space 
of time, its hysterical"
2142,3,"How much longer are Americans going to turn a blind eye to what's happening 
to this Country! This Country is just getting used and abused! Its time for 
some tough love! Its time for a President with some freaking BALLS! Not a 
freaking VAGINA! "

2152,3,"He haven't mentioned WHY Obama Care is so quote:""bad and horrible, a total 
disaster"" And it's not the only time he didn't explain his opinion."
2153,0,Sounds like donald has a little sniff problem. Must be good gear
2154,3,bruh great because were good like grammar hello?

o.o"
2156,3,Ken Bone!!!!!
2157,3,did I just see a fly go on her face? lmao
2158,3,"Talking about yourself in the 3d person is a characteristic of anti-social 
personality disorder (narcissism) as is feeling threatened, being unable to 
recognize your faults and shortcomings. And pathological lying (76%, 70 
times in a single speech, or every 5 minutes depending on how you count 
them). Saying the President's mother was not in the hospital is an example 
of one such lie--we have seen the guy who was born the same night as Obama 
in the same hospital. He remembers his family talking a lot about meeting 
the Obama family. 

Then we have the newspaper announcement--only the hospital can place those 
announcements. We also saw an interview with a fellow student /teacher at 
the university with Obama's parents--it was a big deal that she was 
pregnant there because students did not have babies. Then they brought the 
babies to parties. So much proof of his birth in Hawaii--yet he never will 
admit he was wrong--he just makes up new lies. 'People pouring over the 
border"" is yet another lie--illegal immigration is net zero--as many leave 
as come. He lies and lies. As is car companies stealing our business--it 
was GM's best year!

That ""unifier"" language is straight out of Hitler's M.O.--his last tactic 
after the extreme nationalism, creation of the ""other"" as the ones 
responsible for everything that's wrong in America, the blocking of 
emigration, immigration, the creation of classes of citizenship--certain 
groups must do more and get less, throwing out people with certain beliefs 
(here protected by the Constitution), marking people with insignia and even 
tattoos (I heard him suggest tattoos on the faces of Muslims), and marking 
their documents with religious affiliation/beliefs. Hitler then pivoted to 
becoming the ""unifier"" on the last Sunday in January 1933. On Tuesday I 
think it was--January 30th, the President appointed him Chancellor--he 
never acted as unifier, instead imprisoning communists (the largest 
political faction in the Reichstag (legislature) in the first concentration 
camp, Dachau. He then built 1 per quarter, then one per month and 
eventually put anyone with a hereditary illness, gypsies, homosexuals, and 
Jews inside, once the communists were gone... He transitioned them to slave 
labor camps, then set a 90 day limit on prisoners' usefulness, at which 
point they were scheduled to be dead of starvation, illness, or violence. 
Finally, full of Jews and eastern Europeans, the Final Solution was 
introduced, expanding techniques long used on mental patients and those 
born with debilitating illnesses to Jews and Eastern Europeans. Firing 
squads, gassing... Some unifier. 

Trump loves authoritarian leaders. People are always shocked by these 
rulers later, but they rarely change their stripes. They telegraph their 
intentions, tactics...they say what they like, write about it. His fans 
should wake-up. I know they hate books, studying, boring things. But grow 
up! The country is not a TV show. Go to Hollywood, take tours, go to 
tapings! Don't elect a TV reality host to the most complex, dangerous, 
powerful position on Earth, where even a thoughtless word can cause other 
rulers to invade innocent countries as Saddam has Kuwait, China has Tibet, 
and threatened Nepal and India, Japan has Korea, China and Mongolia and 
Russia has countless countries, most recently Crimea, a region of Ukraine. 
Russia is not massing tanks on Ukraine's border. 

Trump is saying he will hire such better employees to vet immigrantsa...but 
look at people he really hires--he can't even stand them more than a few 
months! It's the best example of incompetence. How would a man who never 
had a job in govt, never even worked on a city council, never even won an 
election to run the local dogpound going to suddenly hire the world's 
greatest employees, and specialists in vetting immigrants--requiring 
language abilities, cultural understanding and experience and a huge dose 
of psychology, and the kind of truth and lie identifying, straight out of 
the gate in Washington--when his days would be filled with mending fences 
with people who he dissed big time and have no reason to work with him...he 
needs them to approve his cabinet, initiatives, funding, and appointments 
to posts around the world. In addition to the full-time job of crisis 
management, diplomacy, etc. The comparison to Reagan ignores the 8 years he 
served running the 7th or 8th largest economy on Earth, the many loyal 
people who had worked for him and knew the jobs, knew the boss, knew each 
other. And he had been running for half a decade, planning planning and 
planning, as were people who supported him in the State Dept, military, 
Congress, the Attorney General... Trump has zero. ZERO. 

Seriously, Chis Christie and Mike Pence (a former radio host after all, not 
an attorney or economist, or even CEO of a big company (these family-run 
tiny businesses like W. and Trump run--where Trump hires one guy to run 
each hotel and each golf course, waiting for their reports, just do not 
count. Trump has no experience hiring on huge levels, managing law 
enforcement, prosecutors and a Justice Dept, a labor dept, the EPA he can't 
even name, the State Dept, etc etc. It's not staging contract negotiations 
because you must see these same people year after year after year. And 
Trump would have to trust and delegate entire chunks--and we've seen what 
self-serving actions these fools take when they get some power...invading 
Iraq looking for fake WMDs, without Kevlar vests on soldiers, or kevlar 
reinforcing on tanks and trucks. Cheney stole everything in the treasury 
for Halliburton--his first loyalty, and now he is a multi, multi 
millionaire...people cannot be trusted if you can't review them 
knowledgeably. 

But Trump does not know world or American history, does not know the govt, 
the world, its leaders...he really thinks aliens are ""pouring"" over the 
border....and jobs can be brought back--even tho 7 to 9 in every 10 jobs 
lost was lost to mechanization. And now China is losing its jobs to 
mechanization and to other countries who are poorer and can work cheaper 
because they live in grass huts. Trump could not learn everything he would 
need to know in a year, if he wanted to, and he has NO intellectual 
curiosity! He could not care less. Dunning Kruger Effect magnified for the 
size of his ego.

2159,3,Why does the blonde lady always sound like she is about to cry?
2160,3,I don't like Hilary because she evil she is brainwash by the devil

am so glad i am not american. I wish all of you so much luck and strength 
in these hard times!"
2162,3,"im a georgian i dont live in the US but i kinda agree with both of them i 
mean america is filled with lots of people and some of them must go back to 
theyre rightful countrys and i also agree with clinton-trump cant just kick 
people out of america just because there not born there.in the end i still 
think that hillary will win :D"
2163,3,Is it still illegal for a child to run?
2164,3,"Hillary needs to stop acting like she is team OBAMA. This is all politics. 
You scratch my back I'll scratch your back!. Once this is all over you will 
see Hillary coming out of one of Trumps over priced expensive hotels waving 
and smiling at folks. Both will be saying gotcha suckers. No matter what, 
we as a nation is in trouble nothing is going to get us out of this 
trillion dollar debt but wiping out the country."
2165,3,"they should just silent their microphones when their time is up.. they have 
a clock they see to know how much time they have left ,.."
2166,3,Hilary's stupid&disgusting smile
2167,3,"Yeah, she has promised the .01% who now admit in 2016 to owning 99% of the 
WORLDS WEALTH- whilst the rest of us BILLIONS & BILLIONS split the 1% 
they've yet to steal from us- that she would start wwiii... she's in bed 
with the same neo con century for a new America dual citizenship Israel/US 
traitors that it's been PROVEN BEYOND ANY DOUBT helped Mossad and 
Rothschilds M15 do 9/11 as a false flag- she wants to shoot down Russian 
fighter jets for destroying Mossad and CIA and M15's funded terrorists on a 
leash ISIL or ISIS or AL QUEDA- C, they're ALL the same... I voted for 
Obama and he did the exact OPPOSITE he promised and carried on bush's 
deregulation of the banks that engineered the 2008 economic collapse just 
like the 1930's- ALL the neo Coke and bush's are voting for Hillary- that 
doesn't WORRY u stupid Hillary supporters? Are u insane? BOTH PARTIES ARE 
100% OWNED BY THE .01% who brought u 9/11 & Iraq- it is NOT a ""conspiracy 
theory""- its conspiracy FACT- look at all the current and former government 
officials, NSA CIA FBI etc Intel agents, navy and Air Force fighter pilots, 
army and Air Force generals- navy admirals, demolitionsAnd explosives 
experts- etc etc etc- were talking highly accredited and successful 
professionals who kno the FACTS of over 200 Mossad agents arrested and 
illegally quietly had their charges dropped and were deported before anyone 
could interrogate them-- these people are evil and scum and the only people 
who don't know that are voting for Hillary and still believe the 
gobblesesque hitlerian reichsministry of propaganda major news networks. 
These people haven't bothered to read all the recent Wikileaks and believe 
this bs Hillary says about Russian hackers. Well if Russian hackers really 
WERE responsible for showing us that she paid over half a million to the 
wife of the FBI agent who later cleared her of serious breaches of security 
protocols that make her absolutely unfit to be POTUS- and of thousands of 
illegals collisions with the major networks to steal the election and of 
hiring people to infiltrate trump rallies and start violence to get on the 
news etc etc etc- she has personally magnified all that the obamas and 
bushes and Kerry and all the other .01% meat puppet bought and paid for 
goons from both fake parties have done to damage the constitution and 
Republic and is their last breath all or nothing desperation candidate and 
they know thy will never win legally or without cheating and even if they 
try to steal it they are done for cuz she has literally zero base anymore 
except the brainwashed sheeple few but the 99% is awake and mad as hell and 
these are the death throes of the 01%.... obviously it would be best if 
Americans had been awake early enough to vote for stein but the entire 
bought and paid for DC political establishment both right and left is 
totally supporting her and afraid of trump and the changes he will make esp 
reinvigorating the constitution and shutting down the fed etc - - this is 
bigger than him and not about him as much as beating them once and for 
all.P"

2202,3,Hillary Clinton is evil.
2203,1,"for me this election is odd I wasn't going to vote I don't normally care 
about politics the only reason I am voting is
to keep hillary clinton out of the white house. due to her mishandling of 
classified information, her taking massive amounts of
money from corporate backers, due to her sociopathic use of accusations of 
sexual misconduct against her opponent while having silenced multiple 
victims of sexual assault in the past when it suited her, her pulling money 
out of her foundation that
was intended to help people she insist's are going to be oppressed by her 
opponents, as well a large number of people who were supposed to testify 
against her have turned up dead and the fact she will likely start ww3 with 
russia I would have to say for me this election is about the morality of 
the candidates and don't misunderstand I don't think donald trump is an 
angel 
but even though I am a libertarian I would sacrifice every political view I 
have to keep that warmongering sociopath out of the white house I WOULD 
HAVE VOTED FOR BERNIE SANDERS OVER HER AND HE AND I DONT AGREE ON ANYTHING.
I feel sorry for american democrats that this wretched woman managed to 
sabotage bernies bid for the democratic nomination
as while I don't agree with his politics I wouldn't have bothered to vote 
against him since I think he is just a human with 
different political views then me and not actually a bad person (at least 
by politician standards) this woman stole your dnc nomination, she has 
silenced victims of sexual assault when it suited her, she breaks the laws 
of this country whenever she wants, is in the pocket of numerous corporate 
backers, is suspected though not proven guilty by myself and others of 
having people who testify against her killed, has been disgustingly 
contempt filled towards her own supporters in her emails,and people who 
work for her HAVE BEEN CAUGHT ON VIDEO admitting to voter fraud, and 
inciting violence at trump rallies.
AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF she is attempting actions that could spark a third 
world war. american liberals I implore you please
do not vote for this women she doesn't care about you,she has galvanized 
your opposition in this race,she has stolen your nomination from you, shown 
contempt for you,and lied to you. I understand fully your dislike of donald 
trump on both a personal level as he is brash and vulgar and on a political 
level I will never fault you for disagreeing with me or mister trump 
about political issues but the worst the man will do deregulate american 
business and make it difficult to immigrate to this country hillary will 
start a world war please don't let this sociopath play you. sanders or 
someone else can be elected on the
next go around but we have to have not been nuked in the next four years 
for that to happen PLEASE don't vote for her.
that said I hold no contempt for you even if you ignore me here. if you 
read this far I thank you for your time 
and regardless of weather this changes your opinion or you just move one or 
even if you spend the next week flaming me
I wish you the best"

2224,3,"It's quite embarrassing to see how low this country has come to as to even 
consider these two as candidates to run the U.S. I am not huge on politics. 
However, skimming through this video, I have concluded that Donald Trump 
makes up an answer right on the spot to all the questions he has received. 
And although I go for neither, at least Hilary Clinton is trying to portray 
a more mature and professional manner in front of the public. This has to 
be the most childish debate I've ever witnessed. I still believe voting is 
just for show, and that the government has all their plans set, in other 
words, it seems like what the people have to say, don't really matter."

their program and solutions for your country. Sad."

MSNBC, New York Times, Wallstreet Journal, The Washington Post and other 
mainstream media sources for there ""News"" These sources back Clinton and 
the Elite that support her in Washington DC and around the world. They are 
against Trump because Donald Trump is fighting for the people. He speaks 
from the heart, he is honest, he has exposed the corruption in Washington

Trump calls for the restoration of Glass-Steagall. ""Yes, but it's sexist!""

Then Trump is just a friend of Saudi Arabia and Qatar, masters of Italian

general get woman throwing themselves onto them and they just grab them by

running"" Just think of what you are saying.. what a bad excuse. Letting 
Bill Clinton ANYWHERE NEAR the white house should be banned. IF I was Trump

so they could NEVER enter the white house again. Those 2. Bill and Hill. 
They both ruined others lives! Such great people went to jail for doing 
just 1 of the bad things she's done. This is a fact. I can name hundreds of

2389,3,"I'm sorry...but I think I'd feel just a tad more comfortable with the 
country in Hillary's hands than in his. His characteristics an demeanor and 
some of the things he says are so immature & outlandish I really can't 
believe he's gotten this far. I don't want someone like this representing & 
dictating us at all. His personality is just too unattractive for my 
comfort & trust levels. I loved Bill as our president, and I think she'd 
rekindle a lot of the ways he ran the country. This guy here, no ma'am...I 
just don't like this rude pushy fellow and I don't want him to be the our 
president, I just can't stand this guy. HILLARY 100%!"
2390,3,"I will never understand how people can say some of the things being said 
throughout this election. No matter who you choose to vote for, it is not 
right to say any of the candidates should commit suicide or be murdered. It 
is also very silly to assume that World War III is going to breakout due to 
the results of this election, or that this country is headed towards the 
apocalypse. With that being said though, Donald Trump is the best candidate 
we could vote for, because otherwise, our country will be worse off. His 
only real competition is Hillary Clinton, who has proven herself to be a 
crooked and corrupt politician; any third-party candidate currently running 
for president stands no chance of actually winning. 


Donald Trump is nowhere near as bad as people think he is. Despite popular 
belief, he is not going to lead our country into an era of racism, sexism, 
xenophobia, or hate. Sure, he has said some pretty offensive things, but 
that just shows that he is an actual person who does not try to be 
politically correct in order to just win the vote. We have all said things 
that we regret or did not mean, and that makes us human. Politicians like 
Hillary Clinton have said things almost as bad as what Trump has said, but 
only in private. For example, as much as people like to point to out that 
Donald Trump has accused President Barack Obama of being born in Kenya, it 
was a Clinton employee who first suggested it. According to Joshua 
Muravchik in “Hillary Clinton’s Bad Old Days”, “Clinton-family retainer 
Sidney Blumenthal had furnished the material on Obama’s past” (34). Clinton 
is unreliable and has crooked ways, as she now claims to support Obama.


Hillary Clinton’s corruption as a politician is also demonstrated by the 
way that she can be “bought”. Many people believe that she is nothing more 
than a puppet for large corporations and rich people that donate to her 
foundation. As Sam Frizell points out in “The Benefits of Friendship with 
Hillary Clinton”, “half the private individuals whom Clinton met with… 
donated to the foundation. That’s 85 out of 154 people” (5). This 
contradicts a Clinton quote that Frizell also brings to attention, 
“‘Democracy can't just be for billionaires’” (6). Donald Trump is a 
billionaire who worked throughout his life to get to this point, and will 
not be easily bought, as he is not hungry for the money. The same can not 
be said for Hillary. 


I understand why so many people are reluctant to give Donald Trump a 
chance. He’s a loudmouth who lacks political experience, but compared to 
Hillary, he is safe. He has proven that he understands the economy with the 
fact that he has done so well, and he has policies that could help our 
country. Many people may be put off by what Trump has said about some 
things, such as illegal immigrants, and his idea of “building a wall” to 
keep them from coming into the United States. Those people just 
misunderstand though, as Trump claims in his book Crippled America: How to 
Make America Great Again, “I don’t want to stop legal immigration to this 
country. In fact, I would like to reform and increase immigration in some 
important ways” (29). I believe that many of his other policies may be 
misunderstood as well, but in time, if he becomes president, we will see 
that he has what is best for our country in mind. In regard to those voting 
for a third-party candidate, you are just wasting your vote. Your 
frustration with both major candidates is understandable, but please think 
about which of them will be better for our country, as you could be making 
a huge mistake by not voting for them. Donald Trump is not the only the 
most fit candidate for presidency, but perhaps the only fit candidate."

I think Hillarys plan for WW3 is more focused on helping all Americans. If 
we're all dead no one has any problems left, And its all perfectly fair.

2413,3,"Voters like Trump because he talks the way they do. People always shouting 
at the tv or the computer screen about things they don't like what's going 
on in the country and other countries. Well, there is a difference. When we 
talk like that, we're not in the public's eye like tv or the internet with 
people all over the country and other countries watching us and hearing us, 
therefore, there aren't any consequences when we do it. But when a you talk 
like that in the public's eye, there ARE consequences for it and if you're 
president the consequences don't just come to you but to the country as 
well. Trump has been talking like that a lot and a lot of people don't like 
it. If you were running, would you dare talk like that in the public's eye? 
Past presidents have always been well aware of that which is why they 
always talk in cool, calm matter no matter how upset they are."

Donald Trump is businessman and he will be benefited (this could be a great 
clear reason). Hillary Clinton worked for government and country from very 
many years and she has more experience than Trump. I think that Clinton 
will be better president than Trump. We haven't seen the power of woman 
till now and now its time to. Trump could be threat to country and people

2433,2,TRUMP #1 THE SOUTH WILL RISE AGAIN
2434,3,"Trump is like poison. Trump supporters like him because of a few reasons



1) People were so afraid of being rude and racist to others because they 
could get in trouble or hurt, but now since there is a popular racist rich 
guy, they can let everything out.

2) He owns a million dollar company. People think that with money he can do 
anything and it's true, he can bribe ANYONE into doing ANYTHING. 

3) He goes against all the stereotypes. Because of vines and websites, 
everyone has a specific thought on a person or race. Trump takes advantage 
of this and makes people hate and be afraid of these people. This helps him 
on his way to build a wall and deport millions of people. 

4) He only talks about immigrants and why Hillary is bad while Hillary 
talks about the countries status and future. But with all trump has said, 
he has made people hate Hillary.

Now the reasons why he would be. A bad president. I know Hillary has made 
mistakes and has lied and said some things, but trump has made WAY MORE 
than Hillary. 

Trump goes to Mexico, makes the president trust him, (lie), comes back and 
rants about Mexico, He said he loves Mexicans, (lie), wants to deport them, 
he says women are great and he respect them, (lie), He later goes on and 
insults them and has have been recorded with sexual assaults and racism.

If he deports people, the economy will go way down since even though many 
jobs will be open for Americans, there won't be enough to fill in the gap 
left from the millions of people that got deported. Farms will no longer be 
occupied by Mexicans and immigrants, and helpers of American farmers since 
no one will want to do those jobs causing a major depletion of food. And 
since he will stop importing things from many countries including food, 
causing more food depletion. 

Also other countries will become over populated and will cause major 
problems with increased food production needed and with many buildings left 
in America after people abandoned them, there will be thousands of acres 
worth of land wasted.




Think of the future. You hold the fate of America and the world in your 
hands. Become a hero. Choose what is right. Vote for Hillary. 




#DumpTrump #HillaryForPresident"
2435,3,"“Donald Trump is running for president.” I think we all had the same 
reaction when we heard this news but now we probably have some different 
views. Although we may disagree on many things I believe one thing we can 
agree on is that these are two of the worst candidates we’ve ever had in 
American history. 
I was 100% anti-Trump when he proposed his candidacy, but through following 
the election he seems to be the best option we have in 2016. Though he has 
said some extremely radical things, such as building a wall to keep illegal 
immigrants from coming across the border, that is not a bad idea. He is not 
saying he wants to deport ALL immigrants. Trump is just enforcing a law 
because it is in fact illegal to be in America ILLEGALLY.
“The current official unemployment rate for Hispanics is 9.1 percent, 
compared to 7.6 percent for the nation as a whole.” It is understandable 
for Donald Trump to be upset with these numbers because they are increasing 
our country as a whole’s numbers. Hispanic voters are mostly against the 
republican party but there are “new forces” who are fighting for 
immigration reform and fair treatment for Latinos. 46% of voters in a poll 
agree with this statement. Some people say this is morally wrong but if you 
look back to the Sedition Act of 1798 the federalists discouraged low life 
immigrants and wanted to grant president the right to deport the unwanted. 
With that being said these views are not a new idea to a person of 
political importance. 
CNN has caught Trump in some bad situation. Such as an audio recording 
where Trump speaks of his daughter’s breasts, three-way sex, and him not 
dating women older than 35. Also, caught on the recording was talk of him 
“barging” into beauty pageant dressing rooms. Trumps running mate, Mike 
Pence, says he is “distraught about all of Trumps doings.” Although this 
may be true his disrespect does not even amount to the torture and acts of 
malice toward women by Isis. Trump will still provide women with the same 
opportunities as others in a professional manner."

You have the choice between Trump, an unscrupulous Businessman and Clinton, 
a woman that did some very poor decisions during her life; but she is the 
only chance for America. Obama did something wrong, like any other 
president too, cause nobody's perfect, but he did steps into the right 
direction and Clinton can expand this. America is stronger together, 
America dont need someone who is trying to divide its people into Muslims, 
Hispanics and Americans. In my country, guns are prohibited and it works 
very well. We dont have a shoot-out in a public school every two months and 
that high amount of firearm deaths. Trump wants to keep his Citizens safe 
and create prosperity but he denies the gunfact. Clinton however tries like 
Obama too, to decrease the amount of weapons. In fact, if you elect Trump 
for the next 4 years, you have to life with the consequences, and not just 
you, the whole world has to deal with this decision. So, do yourself and 
the world a favor and vote for Clinton. Reality has no rewind

2465,0,"I am only 12 years old and this is my only off day and I'm spending my time 
looking at the presidential debate because I really want to understand 
what's going around in my world. people that vote for Donald Trump are just 
looking about how much money he has and I just probably bribed in some way 
, but Hillary Clinton will be the perfect person for the job. I don't know 
much about the presidential debate because I am so long but from what I 
hear I think Hillary Clinton is the best person for the job because she 
gets her point across and she's very thorough about how she will make 
America great again. people like Donald Trump are business owners and all 
they care about is money now I'm not saying that Donald Trump is in a good 
person in that doesn't his point across but he doesn't really focus on the 
topic.Now you can look at both sides Donald Trump wants to make it legal 
for anyone to be able to have a gun and he wants to build a wall to reduce 
the amount of immigration. Hillary Clinton wants back background checks on 
people when they are trying to purchase a gun for our safety as well as for 
kids and she wants to reduce the amount of poverty in America by making 
things more affordable especially when it comes to people that are able to 
afford for their children to go to college. I understand why Donald Trump 
is coming from when he wants to keep out people that will harm us but it 
still doesn't mean that people that have been here for hundreds and 
hundreds of years they should just go back to somewhere that wasn't either 
comfortable or a good position for their families. Hillary Clinton wants us 
all to be equal. the presidential debate is really confusing for someone my 
age but the only things that I take out of it is that Hillary Clinton will 
provide safety and money for people in need and for children. Hillary 
Clinton is not selfish and cares about others before thinking about 
herself. #Hillary Clinton 2016"

2516,3,"Hillary is a disgrace and a big liar!!! All she is saying about Russia and 
Putin is totally WRONG!!! The whole world is laughing about what Hillary is 
talking about! HAHA"
2517,1,"Hillary is a liar. What she's saying about Putin and Russia is just wrong. 
It's only propaganda and lies.
If you want another world war, vote Hillary Killary Hitlary Clinton. If 
not, vote for the candidate of hope - Donald Trump who will do his best to 
make America great and respectable again."
2518,3,"Yeah Trump lost me the second he called Mexicans ""bad hombres"". Why people 
still support him I have no clue. You can go all you want into the ""oh 
Hillary is all talk and no action"", but people in government today don't 
like Trump either, even in the Republican party. He wants to make Mexico 
pay for the wall? Great, that's another diplomatic relationship down the 
crapper. Congress won't approve anything he wants to do. Hillary is 
conventional but competent. Trump is neither. He is a racist, misogynist, 
and completely opposed to the idea of religious freedom, which is what 
brought the first pilgrims here in the first place. Hillary is not a 
fantastic candidate by any means, and if she were running against anyone 
else, she would probably lose. But under Trump, the united states will fall 
into ruin."
2519,3,"Trump is a man with a big ego for himself and don't care about anything or 
anyone.Hillary is not a saint but she is more a people person to deal with 
even if she is tricky.Trump thinks he's a god and has no mercy for people."
2520,3,"trump is gonna cause war with Mexico and Hillary is gonna cause war with 
Russia WW3"
2521,3,"I'm not racist or sexist, but I'm curious how this whole debate would have 
played out if it was just another white man versus another white man"

have to vote for Trump."

America and Russia are friends. Our enemy is ISIS!"

Awful, awful, awful, awful."
2532,3,"First Obama, now Clinton. Politicians.. so boring.. Lock them up! Lock them 
up! In fact look 'm all up over there in DC! We will pick a new congress 
and supreme court from the audience of the next Trump rally. Make America 
great again! Woohoo! (I quess)"
2533,3,"From those 2 different candidates, i will choose Hillary based on her wit 
and experience. I am not saying i love her , i am not defending her but 
take a good look at Trump... This just...can't.. Please United States , go 
for Hillary. Greetings from Europe."
2534,3,"hahaha Trump is an ugly mf. he does the funniest gestures with his hands, 
his squinting eyes look at her when he doesn't agree. hahaha he is actually 
entertaining, and I actually like Trump, he does bring up some good points 
every now, and then. overall throughout these 3 debates it seems that he 
can't follow the structure of the debate, and just answer the questions, it 
always veers off to another topic, about something he's probably repeated 
10 times already lol. I like Trump, but he doesn't seem like he's as fit 
for the job as Hillary is, she's a damn politician, these debates, these 
presidential races are formatted for politicians lol. I'm going to give 
Trump some credit for his efforts being the non politician, too bad he 
wasn't prepared better."
2535,3,"Trump ripped her to shreds. She has no place as being  President of the 
United States.Trump will win by a large margin."
2536,3,"Im sorry Hillary, but im totally against abortion...."
2537,3,"Trump is really mean and I think that if Donald Trump won the American 
election he would start world war 3 on the other hand Hillary is a good 
example to be a good leader in America. She makes mistakes but she always 
says ""yes I have made a mistake but I'm sorry"" she's very good in meany 
ways.SO GO HILLARY !!!!!!!!!!!! Also she is the first female president of 
the United States of America and that profs that woman can be anything."
2538,3,"Let's be clear : all the politicians lie. It's their job. But in addition 
to being a liar, uncle Donald is a creepy person with dirty opinions. Make 
the right choice for you and for the world. Please, sincerely from France 
(sorry for possible bad writing we're french u know)"
2539,3,trump is right for america like icebergs were right for the titanic
2540,1,"For the coming US election, it's quite simple the choice you have to make. 
If you want to see real change with a better economical environment you 
vote for Trump, if you are very conservative and don't want to see big 
changes and want the same elite at the top, you vote for Clinton. And most 
importantly, don't make your choice based on the media, because the media 
is also controlled by this elite. The media has taken one side in this 
election, since the very beginning. And whatever they can do to hurt the 
Trump campaign, they have done it."
2541,3,He don't make any sense what so ever.
2542,3,"TRUMP FOR NATIONAL INTEREST HILLARY FOR GLOBAL INTEREST. that's the basis 
of this election."
2543,3,"hilLIARy had to be married to Bill in order to get where she is today. 
First woman president? Nobody would know who she is if it weren't for her 
husband's career. That's why she stayed married to him despite his being 
very unfaithful. It's not impressive unless she accomplished it 
independently. I'M WAITING FOR A WOMAN WHO PAVED HER OWN WAY."
2544,3,"The commentator interrupts Trump almost each and every time he speaks, but 
0, litterally 0 time Clinton. I for one don't really care what happens to 
this country since I'm no USAian, but I find this very interesting and it's 
been happening in all of the 3 debates. Also, what's ''funny'' is there's a 
third candidate that hasn't been allowed to debate with those two clowns 
and his name is Gary Johnson. Just curious..."

2547,3,"I don't even understand how she can be allowed to run considering she was 
being investigated for a crime while running for pres and btw the FBI just 
reopened that investigation, & congress already reopened it because they 
most of congress disagree with FBI director Comey who was either paid off 
by her or threatened by her same as our AG Lynch, but how could they even 
have a fair investigation when the current pres is for her obviously the 
FBI was being leaned on very heavily to not do they're jobs, anybody else 
would've at the very least have their security clearance taken away so how 
can u have a pres who shouldn't even be allowed to have a security 
clearance at the least and in jail at the most?!?!"

stats like that without help she has always used notes and such to deliver 
speeches if she was talking without it there would be more of a slower 
delivery, she looks down all throughout the speech getting help how does 
she have anything on the podium if she didnt know any of the questions or 
things that would go on. We do need to protect our borders and fix the VA 
and end NAFTA and the tariff against foreign trade would keep jobs here"
2555,3,"Trump claims that the polls will be rigged but already there have been 
charges out on people like a woman name Terri Lynn who was charged for 
double voting at the polls. Ironically, she claimed after being charged 
that she was worried that the polls were rigged. Sooooo, she she decided to 
cheat the system by beating them to it??? Um, Trump is full of crap! He

You people are absoultely DUMB to vote for Trump. Trump is a complete

State being more corrupt than any person to ever run for the Office of 
President Of The United States, it is and was inevitable that someone 
other than established politicians would run. It was also inevitable 
that they would win. Why you may ask? Or not. Because more and more 
citizens of this country have become disgusted with the way The United 
States is going. Progressives, eie the party of Woodrow Wilson, FDR, 
Truman ect did not and do not believe in the Constitution and Bill of 
Rights as a living and just as important document as it was in the 
founding of our country. Little by little, because we do not pay 
attention, we are having our freedoms taken from us. Our short attention
spans will be the destruction of our country as we have known it in the
past. Progressive thought is that the government not only should but 
has the right to involve itself in our live by taking responsibility for
things the Constitution and the Bill of Rights did not give it 
permission and in some cases out right forbid it to do or take. What we 
saw happen in this election is a direct response to a government out of 
control. Americans are waking up. It had to happen sooner or later and 
sooner is best. It is people like Sarah Trachtenburg that think that 
electing a 
person like Clinton is ok even if she is corrupt, a traitor, a betrayer 
of employees of her own department, Benghazi, even if she furthers her 
and Bill's own fortunes off of the relief funds headed to victims of 
terrible events in this world. Even if she has no care for slain 
Americans and can go before Congress and say, and I quote, ""What 
difference does it make."" And even if she can lie through her teeth and 
everyone knows she is lying through her teeth. Have you ever wondered 
why many people who have crossed her are no longer heard from or around?
Yes it is those like Sarah who will be the death of freedom in this 
country. I may not see it. I am 63. But my 20 grandchildren will pay for
our folly and this is Truth."

2634,3,"Republican voters don't want Hillary because they don't think she's a good 
politician. If it's a good politician they want, then why in the primaries 
did they vote for Donald Trump, guy who is not a politician and has no 
political experience to say the least? Marco Rubio was a lot more qualified 
to be president than Trump, so was Ted Cruz. Hell, even Jeb Bush was more 
qualified. What honestly made people believe that Trump was more qualified 
than the other Republican nominees?
Voters have said that Trump talks just the way they do. That's because 
Trump's not a politician just like most of the voters aren't. They don't 
know things work in office. And if Trump becomes president, he's going to 
find out the hard way how things work and is going to realize, very 
quickly, that he's in over his head and that running for president was a 
huge mistake. If Trump realizes that he's in over his head, he's not going 
to resign even if he's advised to because he'll tell his advisors, ""No, if 
I resign then everyone is going to know that I couldn't do this job and if 
that happens, my image will be ruined."" To people like Trump, their image 
is more important than the well-being of the country."

2641,2,"Leader Trump

When the word, “leader”, goes through your mind, do you think of a man or 
woman? Obviously, a woman can be just as or even more manly than a man can 
be. But image is very important to our enemies way of thinking which leads 
to their decisions. Trump is only going to do good things to our military 
and create a GREATLY, assertive image upon our threats. Security is a 
beautiful thing and will keep so much stress away from our minds.

With being president comes great power and with great power, Trump knows 
good and well about great responsibility. Donald Trump seems to have a good 
perspective of responsibility. He has already proven how responsible he is 
with his decision making as a business man. Just from impressions, it might 
seem that he makes risky decisions but within the past decades he hasn’t 
showed us anything but success and extreme productivity. Trump may be 
drastically different, but that also means that he is an ,outside of the 
box, thinker, for example, “He tends to buy properties that have less of an 
upside if they also are a safer choice (i.e., less downside).”.

America’s debt simply and literally needs conservation because of all of 
our investments being made in the last 2 terms. Trump is only bringing 
notice to the most effective problems that don't try to focus on as many 
people’s feelings as possible. He will not make ignorant decisions because 
he has gained more than he has lost from bankruptcy and gained an unlimited 
amount of resources to make him all around successful. Donald Trump has 
proven that he is active and willing to put in work because of his rapid 
amount of trial and error.

Every penny counts as Donald Trump just wants to save/make money along with 
growing our economy more efficiently than ever before. He has a plan to 
reduce most taxes. Trump is tremendously serious about calculations to set 
his goals higher than most people are ready for. Because of most people 
thinking that taxes are inevitable, they just assume that we will lose so 
much money if we cut them but if Trump becomes president I strongly believe 
that money will be one of the least of our worries.

Currently, among our peers and media, we see how Trump supporters just do 
not “fit in”. All the youngins these days just won’t open their mind up a 
little because they never imagined him and his different ideologies 
proceeding in politics. Our fairly new generations don’t understand how 
Trump is the actual republican candidate. Our media has convinced so many 
people that Trump is the most unsophisticated choice, therefore, they also 
want to convince more people to not vote for Trump. This, of course, leads 
to making many republicans feel that Trump just can’t be an option because 
of the pressure other peers have put on them."

stop this! We have to stop this epidemic. Please!"
2646,1,"A vote for trump is a vote for racism, for Putins dictatorship, and for 
sexual predators."
2647,3,"Notice how she looks down when talking about ""Haiti""..and how much she 
contributed she's so full of lies can't even looks straight on the cameras 
or in the audience or host's eyes..Pathetic!"
2648,3,good
2649,3,TRUMP#2016
2650,2,"Am I the only one who is annoyed by the fact that Trump's mic is uneven 
when Hillary's is perfect placed in the center?"
2651,3,"congratulations madam,your a winner...."
2652,3,Hillary Clinton makes more sense than Trump.
2653,3,"Please take the time to read this, like to show that you still care




If you have any emotions as a human left, don't vote for trump. I am 
Hispanic and my parents came from Mexico because they had to look for a 
job. They were separated from their grand parents and parents for many 
years, and now their grandparents can't even come and visit us, not even my 
uncle! My parents will end up being deported leaving me, my sister and my 
pet helpless with no food, water, or money. I may very likely be spending 
my time living in my school. That's not all, over 5,000,000 kids will be 
left alone with no one to help them. Even if we do get help, we will still 
be separated from our loving parents. And over 300 people have said that 
they will commit suicide if trump wins. Not to mention the other deaths 
caused by homeless children and innocent immigrants who have lost 
everything they have worked for. My mom has worked for Allstate for 13 
years and has recently opened up her own agency with Allstate after 4 years 
of school, traveling, and work. My dad has helped many Americans with work 
and projects as well not criticize anyone even if they are racist, 
American, or African American. My mom tries to save lives and supports many 
organizations and has donated thousands of dollars to programs trying to 
save lives.Also think about it, Abraham Lincoln tried his best to keep this 
country together but got killed for his efforts.Martin Luther King Jr. not 
only helped fight for equal rights for African Americans, but Mexicans, 
Hispanics, Muslims, women, and other immigrants who were struggling getting 
a better life.Do you really want a president who is a racist jerk who only 
cares about his own personal gain? I do agree that there are some bad 
people that do some bad crimes, but you don't see trump putting all the 
American criminals and serial killers in jail! Choose what is right. The 
fate of America and millions of lives rests in your hands. You can be a 
hero or a villain. You hold the power. Choose what's right.

2663,3,"That trump and his supporters are just idiots supporting charlatans, a 
women abusers, and a sexual preadators."
2664,3,"It's kind of hilarious how almost exactly 20 minutes in Trump starts to 
lose the grownup act and reverts back to acting like a jittery 5 year old. 
He can't even sit still for half an hour. It's awesome that he's going to 
be sitting in a room for hours negotiating with world leaders, making deals 
and defending our country. Thanks America."
2665,3,"sort out your nation institutionalizing racism, and stop allowing African 
AMERICANS to be gunned down in ghettos or in high streets by cops!"
2666,3,"when i was little my mother showed me how many countries in the world were 
painte d pink in our atlas, the colour of countries that were part of the 
British empire where represented as pink and an awfull lot of countries 
were pink. I am sixty two years old, so that was more or less fifty five 
years ago, since then it has definately been North America who kept peace 
in the world, that is NOrht America has been great since the Kennedy's, a 
bit before, till now, still is the main power in the world, that is when 
America has been greatn much as for many americans other parts of their 
history seems to tbe the great ones. Greatness brings with it actions 
people question, such as Guantalamo,however who can doubt it, America is 
still great, jgreatly good or greatly less good but great. It is the 
country who holds the balance of power of the world, so it is just stupid 
people who talk of when it has been great , it is still great now as great 
as ancient Rome."
2667,3,"Greetings Youtube. My name is Yaav Benjamin Polus and I hail from Fort 
Worth, Texas. My occupation is producing squash. Simply put, I am a squash 
baron. I am the biggest producer of sqaush in the U.S and I have business 
deals with Mexico, Canada, Russia, France, England, and other various 
foreign countries. Due to my job and my wealth, I am a target for other 
rival squash barons around Texas and even from other states. I would like 
to propose an offer to the gun-toting folks on Youtube. The offer includes 
protecting my crops and defending my mansion from critters, thieves, and 
other types of beings that would wish to commit harm on my crops, which 
would also effect my business. I pay $75 per hour and I've established my 
own barracks on my land, and also food and beverages are provided. I do not 
provide guns though; you will have to have have your own firearm and that 
is why I'm asking you guys. Consider this offer because it is a very good 
one. Thank you and have a nice day."

sitting there laughing , soullessly going thru lines her corrupt DMC has 
fed her . She is merely a puppet that's owned and paid , has done nothing ,

greatest moments in US history."
2682,3,"Sometimes, I can't tell the difference from SNL and reality."

the reason to vote against Trump even though Clinton accepts millions from 
Arab countries that FUND RADICAL ISLAM. ........"
2684,3,damn I'm glad she didn't win...
2685,3,1:07:56 she has an earpiece it's so obvious glad she lost
2686,3,"Drumpf has a face like a baboon's ass and a hair piece that looks like a 
dead hamster on top of his head! It's just absurd this buffoon is elected 
as president not that Hitlery is any better! Lol"
2687,1,"Justice to all the Arab peoples vote in American elections because the 
American president will control 21 weakling Jaen Arabic
painful truth"
2688,3,"She's worried about Toddlers getting to guns..BUT supports Abortion even in 
third term abortions? what a bunch of junk!"
2689,1,"""You encourage espionage against our people"" hmm..... so following laws was 
in her agenda? When did she chime in where Obama on video said there will 
not be any consequences for illegals that illegally vote for this election?"
2690,3,thank god a criminal didn't win
2691,3,"Trump is nothing but a big liar leading a bunch of racist, bigots, and

she said Trump will win (If you want to of course)*"
2693,2,"Never would have guessed ASSANGE, PUTIN, TRUMP, and the FBI in bed 
together."
2694,3,Lmao I've never laughed so hard.
2695,3,Clinton doesn't understand when Trump is trying to explain
2696,3,"Why should we allow heroine into our country. There are all sorts of hard 
drugs in rio down in brazil and look what has happened to that country."
2697,3,What is that hand thing Hillary does at the end? 😂
2698,3,"I'd like to punch Nicole Wallace in the face....and I'm a Republican. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP 2016-2024."
2699,3,"Hillary would have made a terrible president. Would have been scandal after 
scandal, as it has ALWAYS been with the Clintons. And she is just so phony. 
I never believed anything she said. How can anyone?"
2700,3,"obama was a total failure. trump really hit the nail on the head when he 
said clinton would be another 4 years of obama. and obama was another 8 
years of bush. obama was basically just a black democrat version of bush. I 
am glad trump won"
2701,3,i glad im not the only person w still watching this.
2702,3,"I don't understand why people come here illegally? Like, why not just take 
the necessary steps you need to be a legal immigrant? It either must be a 
super complicated process to get in, or so bad on the other side of the 
border that people are driven by desperation. Why even risk being separated 
from your family though? Because if Trump's plan to deport all illegals 
immigrants follows through, then that's probably what's going to happen, 
and they'll have no one to blame but themselves for coming here illegally 
in the first place. How are they getting through anyway? Don't we have 
people patrolling the borders? Are they being bribed, or is the border too 
extensive for them that they can't monitor every inch of it?....I just 
don't understand how it all works."
2703,3,"The Wikileaks hacking revealed that Hillary Clinton was informed of what 
the questions were going to be by MSNBC for all the debates. She should 
have hit them all out of the park for that reason, but she didn't."
2704,3,"Who thinks that Trump will judge America to make her state Edmi have sinned 
but will be governed to destroy it and make it a desolation, and after the 
infection spreads to all major countries, including the land begins 
imbalances"
2705,0,"Don't forget to watch the exclusive clip of Hillary and Donald singing 
''Breaking Free'' on my channel!"
2706,3,"Maybe it's not such a bad thing Trump got elected, it could serve as a much 
needed wake-up call to the Democrats and Liberal elites to get their heads 
out of empty liberal rhetoric and actually pursue some centre-left 
democratic socialist policies that benefit the working class."
2707,3,"Would Pres. Elect Trump act objectively towards a foreign country if his 
business were to suffer some great loss? Or even on a range of others 
issues at stake. That's why the conflict of interest question is a very 
valid one."
2708,3,"Obama was disaster, Hillary would have been a catastrophe, Trump is an 
egoistic patriot and we can live with that."
2709,2,"SPOILER:




TRUMP is the new president."
2710,3,"Noticed she never answered the question about her and her husband's 
treatment of women."
2711,3,"""Keep eye on ISIS""?????? (what about ""destroying"" ISIS),,,,,she sold 
weapon, guns to ISIS,,,,,,,(google wiki leaks),,,,,,,,,Trump said he will 
let everyone know about acceptance if H. Clinton wins,,,,news reporter is 
assuming he said he would not accept results if she wins............"
2712,3,I support Trump!Trump for 2016!he can make America great again!!

2726,3,"And Trump one. Literally ripped the corrupt DNC machine and kicked their 
ass!! Look at the huge boost to the stock market!!"

Person~!LOL"
2738,3,I'm from upstate new York :D
2739,3,"Arguably the answer at 1:18:00 was the worst moment for Hillary. She gets 
asked a question about her No-Fly-Zone policy, doesn't seem to answer it, 
and does nothing to quell any fears that her presidency could lead to war 
with Russia. Instead, she talks about the refugee crisis which has nothing 
to do with anything"
2740,3,Sucks for all the hillary supporters because trump won! Ha😂
2741,3,I want my American privileges. I was born here.
2742,3,This could be watched just to laugh at and make your mood good.
2743,3,"Oh, smile for the camera, Hillary smile! :-)"
2744,3,"she miscalculated one interesting point - american men, white in 
particular, are fed up with american women. and she talks and acts like 
one..."

2751,3,"Haha people calling Trump predator have you check Clinton history?Bill 
Clinton ?He is he has rape woman Monica Lewinsky ring any bell? Any proof 
on Trump ? Don't believe the media brainwashing fool"
2752,3,if you saw Hillarys Ameicas doumentary you would not be thinking that way
2753,3,"It looks like Hilary is on the verge of bursting into tears throughout this 
entire debate."
2754,3,"Hillary Clinton and the whole family in general is one big crap stain in 
American history, and I hope they all just go away until they become dust!"
2755,3,"She should have been immediately arrested after she revealed US nuclear 
response time in this debate which is a highly classified piece of 
information."

i love it"
2757,3,fascinating to watch this again AFTER the election...
2758,3,Trump totally won. u can tell by Hillary face & eyes the lies
2759,3,"""fight climate change""...... We are actually talking about trying to change 
the climate, sit back and think how god dam ridiculous this is. In 100 
years this climate change thing will be seen as the most stupid concept 
that the world has ever heard of. It hasn't been warming in any notable way 
in the last 18 or so years. There is no way that we can prove that any 
previous warming wouldn't have happened anyway. No way at all."
2760,3,"So glad she didn't won hahahaha omg I dont care about Trump I just know she 
is so angry and so poison for her being the loser that she will die as what 
if hahaha"
2761,3,Saturday night live brought me here
2762,3,"I'm so thankful the country finally pulled together against Clinton and 
Obama! These people have really done this country so wrong! I'm glad they 
finally got there's. All that going around congress and doing what they 
want instead. Not calling people killing Americans for what they are, 
Islamic terrorists. Going to other countries speaking against there own 
country and people. Turning there backs on the God this country was built 
apon. So proud we all see it!"
2763,3,"HILLARY KEEPS TALKING EQUAL RIGHTS FOR WOMEN......I WANNA SEE THEM PLAY IN 
THE NFL!!! LMFAO"

2777,3,16:00 Starting to like Hilary. Lets give her a chance to shine
2778,3,"Presidents are the ones who sign laws and confirm them. I'm scared Hilary 
will become president. The government is already corrupted, take a look at 
the poisonous food they allow, and the harsh drugs they allow. The 
government doesn't care about us. Before we think about who should be 
president we should try to consider government change."
2779,3,"I feel like Trump and Hilary are two divorced parents fighting over custody 
of us, but we kinda just wana go live with grandma."
2780,3,"I'm French, so probably i can judge objectively American candidates 
(through documents too obviously). I don't trust trump too much but I'd 
prefer a more honest candidate as him rather than an hypocrite one as Mrs 
Clinton!"

2804,3,"neither of them deserve to be President they both act like kindergartners I 
mean come on ""your the poppet""😕😕"
2805,3,"Dear Hillary Supporters,
I'm 28 years old. Never voted in my life before this election. Why? I 
always felt that the candidates running were always similar to the ones 
running previously. Nothing ever stood out to me. Until this election.

Donald Trump absolutely has his flaws. Not wording things the right way, 
gets angry quick, acts childish, doesn't sound politically correct 
etc......... but i want you to watch him and take a good look at him in the 
past few months. Watch his demeanor. This is a man who doesn't need this 
position. A billionaire who can retire and live a very pleasant life. He 
spent over 100 million dollars so far, has been ridiculed and scorn by the 
media and still has the energy to attend 7 rallies in a day. Let me say 
that again SEVEN RALLIES IN A DAY!

Instead of piggybacking with the media and the celebrities, take a real 
good look at this mans work ethic. Look into his eyes and see the sincerity 
in them. Take a look at his family. My father once told me you can tell a 
lot about a man from his family. His family is respectful, they know that 
hard work brings great things and they know that together they are stronger.

Vote for Hillary if you want, but in the end all you will get with her is 
the same damn thing you got with Obama. Just another politician.

Take a chance with Donald J. Trump. Be unique in a room full of followers. 
Who cares if Lady Gaga or Bon Jovi Or Jay Z backs her for God knows 
whatever reason. Be unique and stand up for what you truly believe in. I 
guarantee, what you believe in, is what Trump wants to make happen in this 
great country we call America.

God Bless You & GET OUT AND VOTE!"
2806,3,Oh wait... This is the real one.... I thought this was an SNL parody
2807,3,"Hillary Clinton may not know that's she might just be following in Bills 
foot steps but it would not be wrong if she becomes the president of 
America but if Donild trump was to no that within all the reason why no 
body wouldn't have trump to win but unless she was the one who was married 
to former president which she will have the power over trump"
2808,1,katy perry Bob de Niro LBJ and Pope Francis vote for Hillary 😁
2809,3,When you live in Canada so. Nothing be happening to you 🚮🤗
2810,3,"why is it that NBC's reporting of this sounds higher in quality than the 
fox news one....when the host is from fox news....."
2811,0,"There aren't any comments on this, so I'm just going to say that Chris 
Wallace did a much better job monitoring this debate than any of the others 
have. He works Donald Trump very well and he's been the most successful out 
of any of the moderators in moving the debate along smoothly. Well done 
sir."
2812,3,"Before the voting they said there is a 75-85% change Silly Hilly would win 
this election, during the elections they suddenly said there is a 95% 
change Big Donald will win this election
Silly Hilly's biggest mistake is calling Trump's voters being """"racists"""""
2813,3,"the president is appointed from the beggining. citizens have no choice, 
they make us believe we do lol"
2814,3,"Don't even know his name, but the dude who keeps telling who to talk is 
really annoying.
""Some statement"" *in the background as someone is speaking... ""Wai. wai. 
wait. wait. secretary.secretary. wait"" This guy may as well be the person 
that reminds the teacher there was homework or the one who needs all the 
attention."
2815,3,Zimbabwean is with you mr trump let's make Zimbabwean great again
2816,3,what are 3 things the moderator asked
2817,3,Sounds like Hillary even paid those reporters talking after the debate.
2818,1,"Regardless of how we vote, one thing i'm certain of, this election has 
demonstrated how divided America is in it's values.

2870,3,"I am very disturbed by the current political situation. I hear a lot about 
picking the candidate which represents the ""lesser"" evil. Really? Why would 
we want to vote for evil at all? This debate rages, all the while we ignore 
the bigger evil/elephant in the room. We have brought this situation upon 
ourselves. Our Constitution begins with ""We the People.."" not They the 
Politicians. The current state of affairs, or the lack of a good political 
candidate is not the fault of any political party it is the fault of We the 
People. We have become lazy and complacent. We don't want to have to work 
to solve our problems we would rather give them to someone else along with 
the power and authority. We are so complacent in letting others take care 
of things we are even willing to give up our rights as guaranteed in the 
Constitution itself. We have turned Washington from a garden of democracy 
to a cesspool of decadence. America worked because We the People, as a 
whole, stood for something. We always took the higher road. You can't 
legislate morality, it must come from the society. A society that works and 
cares for its individuals. We no longer want to work for what we get 
material or otherwise, we want it handed to us. This sense of entitlement 
is destroying the fundamental principles used to build this country. We 
don't want to face problems in our communities, we want someone else to do 
that. We are even willing to let the state raise our children. It's time to 
wake up! We are the problem. We have become sheep. Why do we allow politics 
to become a career? Why don't we hold our representatives to the same 
higher moral code we want to tread? Why do we let the media tell us what is 
and is not correct? We the People should set the standards, We the People 
should wake up and start caring about our neighbors, our communities and 
our country. The Constitution of the United States is a divinely inspired 
document which paved the way for not only one great nation, but many which 
would follow in her footsteps. It should be the highest law in the land and 
should be our guide. Let's take a look in the mirror and face the real 
problem. We let ourselves deteriorate to this....So what are ""We the 
People"" going to do now? We must make wise decisions even if they are hard, 
not voting is a choice...one our children will have to live with.
Evil triumphs when good men stand by and do nothing!"

more entertaining not presidential material. This debate will make you sip 
tea..."
2894,0,"It was bothersome to see both a Trump rally scare as well as a Kaine 
motorcade accident occur almost simultaneously a few nights ago. I wonder 
whether the boisterous talk surround 2nd Amendment rights riles certain 
people up and gets in their heads the wrong way. That amendment shouldn't 
empower persons to rise up and do whatever comes to their minds simply 
because they feel they have some personal cause to defend. I feel in this 
21st Century era it is ripe time for the 2nd amendment to be reviewed for a 
possible rewriting so that people can receive it in its clarified intent. 
Upholding tradition is good but not so it binds the hands and feet. The 
founding fathers of the American Constitution shouldn't continue to have 
all the say on this for our times, neither a tiny minority hold any review 
process hostage causing lives to needlessly be lost. That certainly appears 
to be the root of home-grown terrorism.

Duel of the Doctors; final round! 

Between Donald, the Dentist (business mogul with honorary merits from the 
university of public opinion and high regard) vs.

Hillary, the Heart Surgeon (juris doctor too)

Specs: 

Donald pulls all kinds of teeth; Hillary could re-start hearts (provided 
that national healthcare doesn't get plucked out as well. Plus the great 
Secretary is generally conciliatory and diplomatic.

Donald is proud that he made himself rich in 'business' (using all the tax 
loopholes he could unearth along the way) but he claims Hillary made 
herself rich in 'politics' - which to him is low down and dirty. I am not 
sure why that should be objectionable and why the Secretary should not be 
able to live as well as the Donald himself. Furthermore I am of the opinion 
that Hillary rather used her wordsmith abilities and capabilities, her time 
and advice, being a learned woman of the law, added to all the fine hats 
she has worn that provided her with tremendously invaluable 
'stock-in-trade'. This should not be shameful or disdainful for anyone, I 
should think.

Donald with the many accusations and charges leveled at him from every 
quarter for acts of discrimination, assaults, tax evasion plus (Seth 
Meyers' list on CNN's Don Lemon is most conclusive). But then the grand 
master - possible 'links' with Russian espionage where they have hacked 
U.S. information systems all around. In one breath Donald says he knows the 
Russian president, in another he says he doesn't (the tapes never lie). 
Talk about corruption? Forget the orange jumpsuit, in times past this would 
have been serious treason and downright treachery.

So what were all the suppositional claims and unsubstantiated steroid 
charges levied against the Secretary Clinton founded on again? Probably an 
attempt at comparing hers and Donald's own pristine record and stellar 
virtues. We know they are stellar because Donald has not admitted 
wrongdoing on any count in any matter.

Hopefully the results of this election finally concludes the official close 
of stone throwing season. Thank you, Jesus."

FBI,  who is a liar... A women who wants to keep Health Care Reform going 
which is falling in the tanks but the even more disturbing problem is that 
she wants to make it a Single Payer System, Government controlled if you 
don't know what that means.   Meaning that the Government is going to say 
what you can and cannot do in regard to your Healthcare.  That is sad..  Is 
that what you want or the Man who yes may be a little troubled when it 
comes to talking about Women ( which I do not believe all of the omen that 
have SUDDENLEY come about their story) a man who yes took advantage of the 
loop holes in taxes but wants to do something about it,  Who does have good 
ideas on keeping the illegals out while keeping those who work legally in. 
It's on your shoulders now.  Try to make the best decision you can clearly

Vegas lie, uttered at the final presidential debate on October 19: “We at 
the Clinton Foundation spend 90 percent — 90 percent of all the money that 
is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own 
country.” The Clinton Slush Fund . . . uh . . . Foundation seems to be 
mainly a travel and full-employment program for Hillary’s government in 
waiting. It’s also a bribe pump that sucks in money and spews out favors.""

2934,3,"You anti Trump people must be being paid 1500 dollars each to write 
negative comments about him. 
Lets compare the two real quick.

A guy who has said some politically incorrect comments about woman, and a 
guy with down syndrome.
A guy who by the way ""JOKINGLY"" said he would grab a woman's vagina... 
people always leave out the part that he was joking, and never actually 
grabbed a woman's vagina in reality.

A woman who lies to the american people on a regular basis, breaks laws and 
gets away with it, uses contribution money donated to her foundation for 
the people of Haiti to pay for her daughters wedding while being worth a 
quarter of a billion dollars.
A woman that is obviously for the establishment, 250 million dollar net 
worth from what? Does she own a business? Does she produce anything? No, 
she is worth 250 million by playing politics and taking pay checks from 
special interests... 
A woman who no one trusts or has faith in, even her closest co workers. A 
woman that is known for being a raging alcoholic again among her closest 
comrades, who are quoted in the Wikileaks emails saying she doesn't even 
make it to 9 am before she is completely drunk. And people wonder why she 
keeps falling over and collapsing... It is called being drunk.
Are you people really so blind to her corruption? Wake up and quit being a 
simple minded idiot... do a bit of research before you make an obviously 
shallow comment. 

Follow Trump back and watch what he has been saying for 30 years, then 
follow Hillary back for 30 years and look at what she has not done while in 
a position to do so. 
There is a handful of people who really call the shots, people who by the 
way give no damn about me you or anybody. They want Hillary, if that is not 
obvious to you then this comment can not help you.

We literally spend an hour of mainstream time on a man jokingly saying some 
piggish things about woman. While spending less then a few minutes covering 
Hillary's deleting 33,000 emails after receiving a federal subpoena to not 
do exactly that...
A woman who is connected to people being paid 1500$ to go and insight 
violence.

Ohh my God did that GUY saying something piggish about a WOMAN!??!?? OH MY 
GOD ARREST THAT MAN!

But wait, that woman over there broke the law about 57 million times and 
was responsible for inciting violence that actually got people hurt in real 
life as opposed to a joke that took place in a guys mind....

Ohh thats no big deal, the guy is definitely the bad guy here... you anti 
Trump people are silly."

3011,3,"India is right now ruled by a corrupt communal party named BJP. The ideas 
of India's BJP and Trump has lot of similarities like their support to 
Crony capitalism, ignorance to sustainable development, mesmerizing words 
on country's superficial economic progress (they never feel scarce to 
supply plenty of flattering words to ordinary people, but all resources 
will go to big fishes only), rigorous campaigns to suppress people's 
rationality by raising their emotional sentiments so that these people 
would be their blind followers with no genuine personal opinions, They 
justify inhuman activities, they are intolerant to minorities and they 
don't intend to uphold humanity. My opinion is.. The responsibility of 
government to take care of it's citizens cannot be handed over to profit 
minded private players. Civilised society is like a tree, reforms should 
pour on top like photosynthesis, Resources should flow from the bottom like 
water and soil nutrients, The tree will become weak if all resources are 
artificially concentrated on the fruits directly. The roots have to grow so 
that the entire tree becomes independent. Although Trump is more likely to 
support India than Clinton, I know very well, choosing an evil's attractive 
deals would always end up unfavourable. In India, the BJP is advancing well 
by acquiring complete control over India with their ideas that are against 
the basic principles of India's constitution."

to deal with Russia, which does not mean, that he is anti-American traitor 
or Putin friend and supporter or whatever... That means, he wants to end 
the regional wars (btw caused by USA) in the world. In conclusion, Hillary

a sociologist to analyse people's interactions, behaviour and notice issues 
surrounding the community of a nation at large,
a decorated top police officer/commissioner who knows all about law and 
order,
a top engineer who knows all about construction and pioneering for the 
future,
a renowned scientist to instigate scientific research valuable to the 
country,,
a financial analyst/actuary to do the best job at keeping the country's 
finances in order,
a medical researcher to advocate for medical/hospital needs
an educator that can speak for all education sectors (primary, secondary, 
and all kinds of tertiary),
a civilian to represent the needs of the people.

That's how the single top job should be redistributed. Perhaps throw in a 
lawyer/judge as well, but otherwise - the one thing we wouldn't need would 
be politicians. This is how ALL countries should be governed (in my 
opinion). One day, I would like to see this happen."

opportunities for working class citizens. I do not believe Hillary has 
shown positive results in her job as Secretary of State or before dating 
back to the Watergate commission. I would like for these candidates and all 
politicians to pay more attention to people who are hurting in this 
country. That means put more of your dollars in to funding research for 
cures of cancer, and debilitating human conditions. I happen to suffer from 
the most painful condition you could ever get, called cluster headache. Its

3355,3,"I think donald trump is too instinctively ,third debate is fairer than 
other tow, progress of debate is better than last ,but trump could not 
describe clear his concept and policy , he spent too much time to hit 
hillary clinton but she didn't, on the a mass of media's work,is not good 
to trump.

I prefer trump because even through he's too instinctively ,but he is a 
strong and successful business man ,instinctively is not big trouble to be 
leader, I don't like Clinton ,the main reason is she always talks 
everythins about policy as machine , for instance : I would set up no-fly 
zone for some chaos zone.
Or I would hike in tax from richmen for heathcare deal of Obama. I would 
reduce deficit for government and so so , but these cases are just 
“cases”,what's reason for case??? How are your actions going to solve 
cases??? Any possible to be worse ? how do you certain your actions is 
strong and thorough to fix trouble , I never see her try to comment that . 
this is what trouble that trump most hit her :she has no judgment. Her way 
of thinking just “if you have headache,let me check head ,if you have 
feetache ,let me check feet” her policy prefers to solve public opinion but 
trouble itself . trump's way of thinking is going to analyze what cuases 
these cases , even through he has no enough of experience in the detail 
because he has no enough of time . but he is really to try to solve trouble 
.

Most of government become to fall and unefficient , that's not reasoned by 
democratic or autocratic . they just become to acting as”if you headache 
,let me check head ,or feet let me check feet too ”,become to dirty 
politician and joker to show by foolish common."

3407,3,"Under economic ideas that have pulled the whole world to the right, 
deregulisation of big industry, less tax for the rich and for big business, 
we have come to a situation in which billionaires are the thing. I myself, 
when I have money, find myself spending it in the shops of the richest men 
in the world Starbucks etc., money does not trickle down it goes on a 
moving staircases and lifts up to the rich.
I spend money on the Koch brothers when i buy petrol, Zara, Wall Mart, this 
last is where i would spend it if i lived in the USA, Macdonalds, 
Smithfeilds, etc., my money goes straight back up to the richest men in the 
world, it does not trickle down. These big industries need to be taxed as 
they used to be in days when the well fare state was the fashion. 
The government pays out the money which it takes in taxes to teachers, 
those who work building roads and other public works schols hospitals, to 
doctors and nurses, while the money of the small man get spent with Steve 
Jobs or Bill Gates, goes straight back to the richest men in the world. It 
is governments which can change the enormouse, more or less monopolies that 
take all the money in the world, not the man on the street trying not to 
use the shops of the richest men in the world.
Laiser Faire as the liberterian economics was called in the nineteenth 
century had to be given up because at the end of the nineteenth century 
because it created monopolies and what we have now is to many more or less 
monopolies and it is a change in economic policies that changes that and 
such a change is not part of the end game of the right. We need Clinton who 
will put the balance back, who will reduce the money of the super rich by 
taxiung tghem and their businesses, businesses which have become so 
ridiculously over the top rich now that they are super millionaires and put 
it back into circulation amoung the less rich."

is the finish line of the race. it is a selling price. but the transaction 
doesn't account for taking people's money. it is earned money. you see the 
gold in the cave of wonder, but you do not touch it or try to take it with 
you. you see it, you see the price that it is selling for and you see the 
value of the product and then you use that to determine how much you are 
going to earn. you have to then get out and do your own thing and earn 
that. you don't take the gold. the gold doesn't belong to you. that is 
stealing. you have to earn the dollar valuation of the gold. you have to 
record it and report it. it is like weight loss. you go to a gym and you 
tell yourself that you want to lose thirty pounds. but in order to actually 
lose those thirty pounds you have to go out work out and shed off the 
weight. you have to earn it. but, i think the real question here is with 
retail stores ... if i am levi company and my jeans are being sold in 
macy's but nobody buys any of my jeans, then after a couple months when the 
seasons change and the shelves need to be restocked with the latest 
fashions why do the close get marked down in price and then donated to like 
good will and charities as opposed to returned back to me the owner as 
unsold goods. why because it was sold. it was sold through the cameras that 
work in loss prevention. it was captured and recorded by the cameras. the 
registers just don't happen to work in a way that they can process a 
payment from someone simply walking into the store. so, what happens is the 
clothes are left abandoned and unclaimed. they were purchased. but they 
were left in lost and found."

3456,3,"this election is a tough election because of the presidencies of the former 
campaigns. the obama administration enlisted a very strong group of young 
people that were in college to help win the office. but, now those young 
people have graduated from college. they are no longer dependents under 
their parents. they are stacked high with student loan debt so they can't 
afford credit cards and business loans or get jobs or apartments or 
anything like that for themself. what they have is a high school degree. a 
diploma. and transcripts.and social media. but the registers in the retail 
stores don't work like that. we can't let the polls in the voting locations 
work like that. so, then how do those people register to vote? and how do 
they vote. they were studying in school some in state some out of state 
they don't have a home because even if they return to their parent's home 
they are not the owner of their parents home they are just a lodger they 
might as well use a hotel address as their address for voter registration 
purposes. they don't have any money that can purchase real property, a car 
a house an apartment, so what can they do. the bush administration utilized 
military families. they utilized the war in iraq and afgghanistan and the 
absantee ballot. so, naturally there was a question and confusion of votes 
being lost in the process or votes not being counted or paper versus 
electronic votes. the clinton administration used a lot of social service 
footprints necessary to repair the war crimes of the kennedy and reagan and 
bush administrations and vietnam wars and so and so forth. so, now we are 
in a difficult position. because we have social media. and, the purpose of 
social media is to negate the lies that big business or big corporations 
were feeding us in the media in order to affect politics. the media would 
say that it is going to rain today and when a person looks outside and sees 
that it is a sunny day without a cloud in sight , then it is the recording 
of that proof on social media that ultimately saves the false accusation. 
so, within this election, unfortunately, whatever the outcome, because the 
country is in a tender point economically and politically, we don't have 
the luxury of not having a sitting president. so, the effort is not in 
whether this party or that party or this person or that person wins or 
loses. rather, it is to make sure that neither either one of our candidates 
who is determined the winner and thus the next president of the united 
states falls, and that this country its economy and political system and so 
forth should too also not fall."

3514,3,"The system is rigged because Gary Johnson and Jill Stein were not in the 
debates. Trump is just a whiney privileged loser who knows he will lose. 
This is the only reason he is saying the election will be rigged against 
him."
3515,1,KILLARY IS EVIL VOTE TRUMP
3516,1,whos vote trump :D
3517,3,trump is best
3518,2,Hail Trump
3519,1,"insight: would you vote for a candidate that NBC promotes???  do you trust 
the news? wow.  watch the last 30 min as they lift up Hillary on a silver 
platter. I don't trust Trump---- but DAMMMM do I not trust Hillary. any 
time the news tells you something remember George Carlin:  ITS ALL 
BULLSHIT. AND ITS BAD FOR YOU."
3520,3,We'll either have a racist or a racist for president. wonderful.
3521,3,lmao
3522,3,don't take away guns
3523,1,"Donald ""dumb ass Trump"" is literally shaking in anger as she corners him on 
FACTS and statements and criticisms made from his OWN MOUTH. If you look at 
Hillary's attack ads she does nothing but get tapes from speeches Donald 
Trump made on his campaign of arrogance and play them back. This man is an 
embarrassment to our society and a pathetic image of spoiled child that 
grew into a man. Hillary is no angel and yes she has lied , however I would 
rather vote for someone that has admitted their mistakes , owns up to them, 
and not vote for a racist asshole who blames the media , The Clinton's , 
The GOP , past and present Republican leaders for HIS OWN MISTAKES. HE IS 
BEYOND ARROGANT , A MODERN DAY HITLER AND A BAD EXAMPLE OF WHAT IS GOOD IN 
THIS COUNTRY. Please vote your conscious on Election Day and think about 
our future and most of all the future of of children."
3524,3,Hillary is stupid
3525,3,Trump is due in court *on 12/16/16* for raping a 13 year-old girl!
3526,1,"Hillary is such an evil human being, how could a single person ever vote 
for her?"
3527,3,"I want that piece of crap to lose so badly and see his stupid face when he 
does"
3528,3,"Under investigation by the FBI and clearly a racist, how does mainstream 
media keep defending Hillary?

3529,3,"i agree with trump on so much. but hillary would make so many more educated 
decisions. if abortion is made illegal you are going to end up with a 
country of people from the ghetto on welfare and food stamps 😂. oh geez. i 
also dont see trump saying anything about becoming eco friendly and 
sustainable. hillary is the one if the states are going to have a very 
competent first woman president anytime soon."
3530,3,it's impossible for this guy's to be elected in United States of America
3531,1,"Oh, yay, cause' I want to vote for someone who might trigger WW111 with her 
stupid no fly zones. Every vote you put towards Hillary will destroy the 
country"
3532,1,"Hillary has been in office for 30 year. Their is no reason for her not to 
be president. Just don't vote Republic 😉"
3533,0,"Donald Trump is sexist and racist and we should not let him lead us, 
Hillary should be our next president"

paths to achieve it."

guys even though she's bad"
3540,3,omg you Americans all need Jesus I swear 😂
3541,3,"I pity for common Americans, you are told wat to do or think by your media."
3542,3,"Her ideas about immigration are frankly scary. And I hate how she always 
smiles like an idiot whenever Trump says something she disagrees with. She 
should just stop smiling, this isn't a beauty pagent. She looks so fake and 
most of the things she says are in contradiction with things she has said 
or done in the past. 
I'm not saying Trump is perfect, but honestly... as we say in France, il 
faut choisir le moins pire (pick the ""less worst"") lol. 
Good luck guys!"
3543,3,Hilary sucks
3544,3,"Trump is just lieng about everything and many racist, supremacist, and 
bigot republicans are loving it."
