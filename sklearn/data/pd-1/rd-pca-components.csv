* Claims that not paying any federal tax makes him smart thereby admitting he doesn't pay any federal tax.

* Claims he will release all his taxes as soon as his audit is finished, followed immediately by claims he has been under audit for 15 years.

* When confronted with accusations that he didn't pay an architect for designing one of his clubhouses he defends it because ""maybe he wasn't happy with the work done"".

* Claims that stop and frisk wasn't ruled unconstitutional, then blames the ruling on an anti-police judge.

* Claims he is not racist because he settled an anti-discrimination lawsuit out of court, and then brags that it was easy to do.

* Claims that he was doing a service to Obama by forcing him to produce his birth certificate.

* Spends 5 minutes on an unstoppable, and fiery, rant about how claims he was a supporter of the invasion of Iraq are wrong, and within 30 seconds of ending claims that he has the best temperament.

* Claims that shooting an Iranian navy ship for taunting US ships wouldn't start a war.

* Claiming that Clinton has been fighting ISIS ""as long as she's been alive"" and seemingly holding her personally accountable for every single bad thing that has happened in the USA in the last 30 years

* Says that China or Iran should take military action against North Korea

* Says that he - the man running for president of the United States - doesn't think very much about NATO, the military alliance that's one of the cornerstones of our foreign policy

Trump made so many flubs and mistakes in the debate. It was pretty hard to keep count. But the biggest one in my opinion was how he buckled down on wanting to blow up an Iranian sailing vessel for taunting us.
