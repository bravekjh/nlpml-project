0,1,Check out the fresh megathread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/54or5a/2016_presidential_race_first_presidential/).
1,4,Remember when Trump admitted that he hasn't paid any taxes at all? Lol.
2,1,"and then claimed it's good business

i'm amazed he has any support since most of his support is poor and middle class white men, the exact people who get screwed when the rich don't pay taxes"
3,1,"It's because he's smart.  And wanting the real estate market to dive in 2006 was just good business.

Oh, and 'Bigly.'"
4,1,"https://twitter.com/jerryspringer/status/780601736327208960

lol"
5,1,400-pound computer hackers!
6,1,There goes that Reddit vote.
7,1,"Considering how popular Fat People Hate was, there's at least a portion who's sticking around."
8,1,That's the voat vote. 
9,1,Chris Christie. As it was said on CBCNN.
10,3,"After 90 minutes of a political debate, I know more about the locations of Trump's properties than I do about his policies."
11,4,"That whole tangent about how he built a resort in Palm Beach or whatever so he can't be racist made so little sense it made my head spin. He just tries to shoe horn in bullshit to make him seem successful at every possible opportunity. And then he said Palm Beach was the wealthiest place in the world, which is not even close, it's not even in the top 100 wealthiest places in the US. Trump loves to exaggerate his wealth and apparently everybody else's too. I don't believe for a second he's actually a billionaire. "
12,4,"Trump on CNN says he's proud that he didn't bring up Bill Clinton's infidelities.

What is happening."
13,1,"A guy who cheated on his first wife, married his mistress, then divorced her, and is currently on wife #3. He really is stunning in his lack of self awareness. "
14,4,"So far in this election cycle, Trump has been caught redhanded doing the exact things he's been accusing Hillary of doing. Hes the king of projection. Makes me think he is having some serious health issues himself."
15,1,My favorite was when he basically told Hilary that she wasn't nice. Like... has he heard anything he's said in the past year?
16,1,Well keep in mind he's also very proud that he started an establishment in Palm Beach that allowed black people.
17,0,Trump is happy with himself that he had the restraint not to mention Bill's infidelity. Just now on CNN.
18,4,"Hillary would've responded ""says the man on his third wife"""
19,1,"""... who had infamously cheated on his first wife.""

IIRC, he cheated on his second wife too but it was certainly big news when he cheated on his first because he married the woman he had the affair with (a young model) shortly after divorcing his wife who was a celebrity herself."
20,1,How can he possibly think bringing up that is a GOOD tactic??! 
21,3,"ya that comment was gross.  said he had some bad things to say about bill clinton, and that hes proud he held back, but maybe youll see at the 2nd debate.  dude is trailer park trash."
22,1,">we have to move on

>WE HAVE TO MOVE ON

>WE HAVE TO MOVE ON

Poor Lester"
23,1,They need to cut mics. Enforce time limits and treat them like children if they need to.
24,3,YES. Why did they not cut off the microphones during their 2 minute speeches? The media didn't want the debate; they wanted the entertainment.
25,1,The candidates would never agree to it.
26,1,"""Please only 20 seconds"" is the funniest thing that was said all night"
27,1,"We can all agree that Trump won the black vote, I hear they love stop and frisk."
28,1,I had to just break out in laughter at that point. Question is about black inequality and says he supports stop and frisk.  Forget about if he's right or not that it will help black communities. Just the fact that he actually thought he would be able to **gain black support** by endorsing **stop and frisk** of all things shows the immeasurable disconnect he has with the black community.
29,1,"When he said this in response to bridging the racial devide I was stunned, actually stunned. Voices went all charlie browns parents for a moment as I let that moment sink in... it's one of the most out of touch responses I've seen... It almost has comedic timing with how confidently it defies comprehension."
30,1,"I didn't think he could do anything to give Clinton more of the black vote, but Stop and Frisk was struck down as Unconstitutional for a reason. He's just so out of touch...."
31,1,My understanding is that he is out of touch on all levels. He should have stayed in the shadows and continued to pay politicians to do his bidding. He would have had auch better shot at having influence and power in government. 
32,1,He's not trying to gain the black vote; it's more dog whistling to his white base.
33,1,"Well he's built very, very good relationships with them over............the last little while. "
34,1,"Yeah, the people in the Harlem bar where I was watching--you know, the ones actually subjected to it--applauded that part. They also loved hearing that they couldn't walk in their own neighborhood without getting shot. (/s for anyone who needs it)"
35,1,"Poor Sean Hannity, nobody ever calls him.  :("
36,1,"> AC on CNN:

> Don't you want someone as President who thinks carefully about the words they say? 

THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS WE ARE ASKING AT THIS POINT."
37,1,"""We don't know who broke into the DNC... Russia? China? Maybe that 4-Chan guy? He weighs like 400 lbs I heard. btw My son is 10 years old. He's good with computers. We have to do better Lester, and the cyber is one of them."""
38,1,"Even funnier, I think he just said ""cyber"", without the security part, similar to what he did with ""nuclear"" later on."
39,1,Well what do you expect? Cyber is a very bigly problem.  /s
40,1,Security is the most important part of Cyber.
41,1,Lol that bit with his son went nowhere
42,1,"One of ""those"" guys that thinks everyone good with a computer is 400 pounds."
43,0,"Lol at Trump on CNN:

*The polls showed that we did great*

*There hasn't been a poll in yet, Mr. Trump*"
44,1,A lot of people have told him how well he did. 
45,1,*Very smart* people
46,1,And they told him! 
47,1,"And they said, they said to him:"
48,1,"You did a great, a really tremendous job. Believe me, folks!"
49,1,Which polls?
50,1,all of them
51,1,Says who?
52,1,I just said. All of them.
53,1,"ok, and your question is?"
54,1,"Honest question here: did Donald basically call for an international protection racket? ""We should only protect countries that pay up"""
55,1,"Yes, that is the entire backbone of his foreign policy. "
56,1,"It would be a shame if anything happened to you, Poland."
57,0,Fox News is even saying Trump performed poorly.
58,1,"Liberal MSM and their BIAS speaking, here!

/s"
59,1,"If it ain't Breitbart ^^^or ^^^Stormfront, it's the biased MSM!"
60,1,"They've never really liked him, and four more Democrat years would be a ratings bonanza."
61,2,"""This was not a normal debate.""

Damn straight."
62,1,"""This is the most abnormal event I have ever witnessed on television"""
63,1,"I dunno, one time the Seahawks passed when they should have run."
64,1,This other time they caught a touchdown that was actually an interception.
65,1,"He said Hillary was ""over-prepared."" That's such a stupid thing to say. "
66,1,"[deleted]  
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.4171 
 > [What is this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/33245)"
67,4,Trump is the guy that makes fun of the smart kid for doing his homework
68,1,He basically just told everyone else that Hillary was prepared and he had no idea what he was doing
69,1,"i mean what do you expect from the guy who said he'd first strike Iran

does this fucking idiot not realize his words have consequences?"
70,4,"[Hillary Clinton listening to Donald Trump answer birther questions](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CtU5ElJWcAIjQoS.jpg:large)

[Source](https://twitter.com/AnnTelnaes)"
71,1,"""Never interrupt your enemy while he is making a mistake."""
72,4,"Trump is going to create a new cabinet position called ""Secretary of The Cyber"" and he's going to appoint his 10 year old son. He's so good with computers it's unbelievable."
73,1,Bar was so low he tripped on it
74,1,"Did he admit to not paying taxes or did I imagine that?
"
75,1,"Not only that, but he said ""that makes me smart"""
76,1,"""9 million people lost their jobs""

""Yeah, it's called business""

wut

Edit: Thanks for the gold"
77,1,"""If Iran taunts us we'll blow them up"""
78,1,"""That would start a war""

""No it wouldn't""

Complete idiot."
79,1,"""Stop and frisk was unconstitutional because of racism""

""THESE ARE BAD PEOPLE!!"""
80,1,"Yet the alt right and all his supporters are quick to criticize the left about ""hurt feelings"" and pc culture. 

""You insult me?! You must die!"""
81,1,"Not even the government of Iran, but some 20 year old idiots on a boat. He wants to start wars that cost trillions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of lives over sailors talking shit."
82,4,"I mean I'm not surprised that he's such a big baby

I bet he would nuke the whole Middle East if a single government official in Pakistan said something bad about him (yes, I know Pakistan isn't in the Middle East, but Trump sure as shit doesn't)"
83,3,I think that line is going to be replayed ad nauseam for the next couple of days until the next debate
84,1,"I think the profiting from he housing crisis as being ""good business"" or ""smart business"" or whatever he said is going to be the takeaway

Edit: http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-on-rooting-for-housing-crisis-thats-called-business-2016-09-26 -- that's what I'm talking about"
85,1,"or the fucking comment on the first strike

or how he had nothing to say on race relations but ""we need law and order"" and his promotion of stop and frisk"
86,1,"He basically admitted to not paying taxes, not paying staff and contractors, etc. What a mess. "
87,2,"Not only that, he compounded it when later in the debate he talked about nations in NATO  not paying their fair share, under treaty, under contract. Does he realize the contradiction?"
88,4,"If cornered, his campaign (probably Conway, I don't know if Trump will actually answer) will respond by saying that it's showing that they're smart to take advantage of us. 

We've been ""dumb"" so far by letting them do so. 

(Not my views, just how I anticipate them responding)"
89,4,Kinda cracked up when Donald said Hillary wasn't nice to her.
90,1,The weird part was when he said he was gonna say something really disrespectful toward Hillary and her family but decided not to cause he realized it was mean. 
91,1,"What a good kind hearted person. He would blow up Iran, stop and frisk people, but he wouldn't dare insult Hillary with whatever it was. What a man."
92,2,Reminded me of the Parks and Recs debate.
93,1,[This one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th7EA6agX-g&feature=youtu.be&t=10)
94,0,Donald Trump is a boy
95,1,"""Guys, she's being mean to me!"" ;_;"
96,4,"I love how the majority of her ""attack ads"" are just videos and sound clips of Trump talking. He writes his own attack ads. She should be thanking him for doing all that hard work for her."
97,1,"""She's been running hundreds of millions of dollars worth of ads attacking me!""

The ads are literally footage from his own rallies. That says something that he considers barely edited repurposed campaign footage to be an insult to him."

Truly prophetic. "
99,2,I felt like I just watched Eric Cartman debate for 90 minutes. 
100,1,Cartman is more articulate.
101,1,Cartman is also smarter. 
102,1,disturbingly accurate. 
103,1,Respect my authoritehh!!
104,1,Cartman is more eloquent 
105,1,Can't wait for the Southpark episode on this!
106,3,"For those of you that experienced your first Presidential Debate, that was not how it usually is. Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, while terse with each other, kept it respectable and policy/information-driven.

Donald Trump is what happens when you let someone with no real experience up on the main stage - a lot of banal, uncomfortable moments. I'm disgusted that this is what it's gotten to."
107,3,"I appreciate this. First year I registered to vote, and the first time I have seen a presidential debate. Even with that said, I knew it would go this way with Trump's demeanor. "
108,0,*Trump's temperament 
109,1,"Every time I wonder what people in other countries think about this shit show of an election, I become embarrassed."
110,1,"Oh, we of other countries don't look at this election so scornfully or mockingly, but rather in shock and disbelief. Either the majority of the US voters has lost  their rootin tootin minds or the US has ceased being a functional democracy. Both scenarios are grim :/"
111,1,"Thank you, I'm young and that was a useful perspective-check."
112,1,"I'd recommend watching either the '08 or '12 debates, then weep at what democracy has lost."
113,2,"I like the combo of debate 1 and 2 of '12. It shows Obama getting beat pretty handedly but still staying composed. Then regrouping and  having a great showing in the second debate. 

Trump was crushed in this debate but somehow I doubt he will learn from it, work hard to prepare for the next one, and come out ready to battle."
114,4,"I think there is a very good discussion to be had over the role of the government.

But that is not what we received here tonight from Trump. Other elections are much much better."
115,3,It's so fucking crazy. I honestly though Mitt sounded like a crazy robot during his debates and cringed at half of his stuff (binders full of women). But now...now Romney seems like serious candidate. 
116,0,"Romney was rich and somewhat disconnected, but he was largely a normal person with proper manners. Trump doesn't have any manners at all. No sense of what constitutes polite discourse. "
117,1,"Holy shit. Did Trump argue that we need stop and frisk across America, as in, the Police can stop anyone one of us without cause, and fondle us to search for illegal items for no reason? How can anyone in favor of liberty and freedom agree with that?"
118,1,"No, no, you misunderstand. That's just for *inner city folk*. You know... *Urban people*. \*wink*"
119,1,Still can't believe he said she's been fighting ISIS her entire adult life
120,1,I don't even know what he was trying to say with that. It was a total non-sequitur. 
121,1,"I still liked, ""I can deal with cybersecurity because, look i have a 10 year old son, he's great with computers, you wouldn't even believe.""
 
Ok......"
122,1,"Imagine the confusion of being that kid right now. 

""What does he mean? Am I in charge of cyber intelligence now? Wtf dad?"""
123,1,This kid can make a minecraft house in ten minutes. Obviously the best at what he does
124,4,"CNN's Trump supporters are pulling out ""well, of course she looked better, she was probably off practicing every week.""

That is the strangest insult I've ever heard."
125,1,Nerd!!!! I mean do we really want someone who is smart and does their own research about the issues? I want someone I can drink a beer with God dammit!!!!!
126,1,"Just like basically every criticism of Hillary. If there's something good to say about her, then its really bad somehow."
127,2,It's almost like it's important to prepare for a debate in front of millions. 
128,1,Political fact checkers will earn their pay checks tonight.
129,1,"They're getting overtime for sure, no ones sleeping tonight. "
130,4,"My favorite quote by far:

""Donald said he would blow those sailors out of the water. That is not the right temperament, to be... Taunted"" - Hillary

""No, *they* were taunting *us*."" - Donald

So SO much irony to that one. "
131,4,"Trump tonight:

http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/sometimes-i-start-a-sentence.jpg"
132,1,"Didn't he say something about ""No it won't"" when Hilary mention that it would start a war by bombing the sailors?

I hope I didn't hear it wrong, beacuse I laughed so much xD"
133,1,"Yes. Yes he did. As if major conflicts, world wars even, were never started as the result of one nations firing on another's warships or transports.

Edit: words n' stuff"
134,1,Oh yeah!  Absolutely fucking unreal.  
135,0,"Remember the gulf of Tonkin incident?

Trump doesn't. "
136,1,"Listen, trust me. We have to assisnate Franz Ferdinand. It totally won't start a war. Trust me."
137,1,"Come now.  When has attacking a boat ever started a war lol


(You know, other than America in WW1, Spanish American war, Pearl Harbor, War of 1812, and Vietnam). "
138,1,"""That wouldn't start a war"" WTF attacking another country would clearly start a war. "
139,1,"Oh please.   The United States of America has only gone to war like, three, *maybe* four times tops, due to a civilian ship being destroyed by a foreign government. 

(It's something like that right? I'm a Canadian but there was that Spanish war ship, the Lusitania for WWI, was Gulf of Tonkin a civilian ship?, and I feel like I'm missing some big one somewhere)."
140,1,"Never thought I'd see ""Stop and Frisk"" DEFENDED on television... But here we are"
141,1,When Mr Bigly told the moderator that Stop and Frisk wasn't ruled unconsitutional I laughed for a minute and then sighed deeply.
142,1,He was told it was unconstitutional... then KEPT ON using it as his main policy proposal. That was like Marco Rubio levels of rote memorization with no thinking on his feet.
143,1,"Not to mention him trying to deny that the murder rate in NYC continued to decline past 500/yr. It literally took me 30 seconds to look that up and prove he was lying: http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_statistics/cs-en-us-city.pdf

I'm honestly trying to be open to his ideas but he just keeps spewing so much bullshit it's hard to take anything he says seriously."
144,1,As a response to a question about race relations.  
145,3,"I feel like we should be relieved that Hillary outclassed Trump every way in policy, ideology, and temperament, but I'm not sure the American electorate is cognizant enough of reality to accept this debate for what it was"
146,0,my mom is a hardcore trump supporter but acknowledged his performance as terrible before turning it off early. lol
147,4,"I think people like a winner. If the narrative in the media is that Trump lost, people who don't follow politics closely will begin to see Hillary as the inevitable winner and next president. Debates are never about specifics on the macro level. They are about momentum, and right now Hillary has it all. "
148,4,"Mod: stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional

Trump: I own property in Chicago "
149,1,"What about the violence in Charlotte?

I own property there, too."
150,1,[deleted]
151,1,"Yes it was.  He also said he didn't pay any federal tax ""because I'm smart"".
"
152,1,Before this he even said he was smart for avoiding paying taxes.
153,4,What was up at the end there? Trump just leaves while Clinton greets the crowd lol
154,1,"Best bit was Donald frothing at the mouth, after several minutes of incomprehensible rhetoric about nuclear, screaming I HAVE THE BEST TEMPERAMENT!!"
155,1,How many times did Hannity orgasm hearing his name mentioned over and over again?
156,1,"""Hillary did very mean things, it was very mean.""
"
157,1,"""Not nice!""

At least he'll get the toddler vote"
158,4,"""I don't know. Maybe. Who knows. Essentially."" - Donald J. Trump"
159,4,"When she accurately made the correlation that Trump's tax avoidance affected Veterans and other Americans in need of tax dollars.. It framed him as a self-ish narcisist, and complete liar. "
160,4,"""We have so many things we need to do better, and certainly cyber is one of them."" - Donald Trump"
161,4,"Clinton ate his lunch. He was visibly upset at numerous points. When Hillary is the one looking at ease and getting the crowd to laugh, you're in deep shit. 

Nearly everything right

-Acknowledged emails were a mistake and moved on. 

-Didn't pull a Gore and get too wonky

-Demonstrated command of facts

-Crushed Trump on birtherism, taxes, stiffing the working man, and terrifying out allies

-Had great responses to him mocking her preparing for debates and her ""stamina"".
"
162,4,I think Trump was more of his own worse enemy. Getting into the birther thing and the Rosie thing he should of just moved on instead of going into those.
163,1,"He can't help himself, he's so fucking petty - temperamentally unfit for office. "
164,1,"That's not true, he has the best temperament. A winning temperament. "
165,1,Didn't he say something like we all agree Rosie deserved it? 
166,1,She should have pointed out how making corporations stay in the country is technically a regulation.
167,0,"The smartest decision was not even saying anything about Trump's Sanders comment. 

"
168,4,"He went from calling her Secy. Clinton to just Hillary.  She definitely got under his skin, but then agsin, it's so very thin, it was expected. "
169,4,I truly don't understand how anyone outside of already diehard Trump supporters could think that he won. I don't believe Hillary did fantastic by any means but Trump couldn't even string together a coherent point.
170,2,what is the purpose of the audience in a debate.. It's just meaningless interruption 
171,1,Usually they are asked to stay silent so they are a non-factor.  I think its mostly for show 
172,1,They were asked to stay silent. They just didn't.
173,4,"One of the parts that stood out most to me was when Hillary said something along the lines of ""By the end of the night, I will be blamed with almost everything that has gone badly"", and Donald responded with ""Why not?"". And Hillary repeated ""Why not"" very sarcastically. It really showed how out of touch with reality Donald and the rest of the alt right really is."
174,3,"I loved how sarcastic Hillary got. It was fantastic. I wanted ice queen Clinton to show up to the debate, but I think I actually like aloof, no-fucks-given, sarcastic Clinton more."
175,1,"Her ""it's a good line"" was fucking fantastic. "
176,4,"The amount of times Trump said ""I never said that"" when he clearly did just blows my mind. How is he even a candidate? He literally had a quote thrown at him and he tried to change what he said on live television!"
177,1,"he denied his comments on global warming, on women and black people, on the Iraq war, on Libya, and all of those are so easily verified

the only people who think he won or got anything other than annihilated are idiots on /r/the_donald who refuse to fact check "
178,1,Wrong /s
179,3,"He won the debate for her. When the moderator says you made a comment, you better be pretty sure before you challenge it. Chances are you'll look like an idiot."
180,1,Especially when you start arguing with a black man about the racist policies that were Stop and Frisk.  
181,1,"I was only listening to it on NPR, didn't know he was black. That makes it much more interesting."
182,4,"Yea, Lester Holt, the moderator, is a black man.  And he's a registered republican.  So it was especially fascinating when Trump accused him last week of being a democrat.  But then even more fascinating was that his campaign defended this error by saying that Trump didn't know that Holt was a republican, which of course begs the question as to how did Trump assume that Holt was a democrat? Because he's black? "
183,1,because his supporters are goldfish with no memory or motivation to look it up and just believe him when he says he didn't say those things 
184,1,"This is patently false. Goldfish have perfectly average memory capabilities, and can even differentiate their owners/caretakers from other humans."
185,1,"My apologies to goldfish, lets say I was referring to the healthy cracker snack"
186,1,This makes me embarrassed for ever being a republican. 
187,1,I felt like I was watching the kid who had two weeks of study time go head to head with the kid who crammed 30 minutes before the test. 
188,3,"Hillary saying that yes, she did prepare for the debate, ""and I also prepared to become President of the United States"" was savage."
189,1,That was the knock-out punch.  Everything after that was him trying to get back up. 
190,1,One liner of the whole night for sure
191,3,I think it's more like the teacher vs a kid whose cheat notes written on his hand got smudged.
192,4,White lady on CNN just told Van Jones that Trump's message to black people was effective tonight.
193,1,"""I have nothing better to offer you"" was pretty loud and clear."
194,1,"If there's one thing black people love most, it's being unconstitutionally stopped and searched by police officers simply because of their skin color.

They're also on board with Iran invading North Korea, I heard."
195,1,It was definitely the shitshow it was hyped up to be. 10 out of fucking 10.
196,3,"I'd also like to remind everyone that Donald Trump all but admitted he doesn't pay taxes.

A self proclaimed billionaire who spent a part of the debate complaining about how we don't have money to pay for infrastructure pays no taxes, and he thought that was an accolade to be proud of. "
197,1,"On top of that, he's also touting the biggest tax cut in history.  So, how exactly will we be fixing that infrastructure?

"
198,1,[deleted]
199,1,"Don't forget that he responded an accusation of taking advantage of the 2008 crisis to rip off people with ""it's business"". So not only is he proud of cheating taxes, he's also proud of making his money at the expense of others. "
200,4,"Is trump really doing what I think he's doing?

Using ""private conversations"" with Sean hannity of all people as evidence that he was against the Iraq war? That is just absurd. I'll bet these conversations never happened and he just threw out Sean's name because he's willing to comply and lie in order to help trump. This guy gets paid handsomely to suck off trump and spout bullshit for the GOP.

Not that I know any of this as fact, I just doubt hannity and trump had much of a relationship back then"
201,3,[This debate summed up] (http://i.imgur.com/ueIbHTc.jpg)
202,4,"As an independent, at the beginning of the election season, I was rooting for Trump. I really wanted something different for our country and always believed that a businessman at the helm will make it better for the little people. But at this point, fuck that, I will wait for someone else. It just cannot be Trump. Too risky."
203,1,[deleted]
204,4,This is the statement that will define why Hillary wins in November.
205,4,I thought Hillary was going to bomb this but she actually looked presidential. I was thinking Trump was going to command the stage (in a good way) but he lost... Especially at the birther and stop and frisk. Dude harassing people (studies indicate mostly minorities) so you feel better is NOT ok. It would be like turning the cops into TSA agents and letting them loose on the street. 
206,1,[removed]
207,1,Nothing will lose him their vote.
208,1,"""hey guys he gave us a shout out"""
209,1,[You're not even kidding](http://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/54ol3s/postdebate_magathread_another_win_for_trump_are/d83mt26)
210,1,Because they're not old enough to vote.
211,1,Cheetos were spilled.  
212,1,I absolutely lost my shit when he said that.
213,3,That's also like half of /pol/
214,1,I just did a Peter Lorre laugh
215,4,"I posted this in response to another comment, but want to unbury it because I see lots of similar comments:

I think Trump should get grilled when he offers half-assed, nonsense responses that completely stray from the question. Someone in here said the moderator is a registered republican, so there's that too. Hillary was prepared, Donald was not. Donald was rude, disrespectful, and at times full of total BS. That may be why it looked like he got grilled."
216,3,">Donald was rude, disrespectful, and at times full of total BS. 

Kind of like how he's been for his entire campaign."
217,4,"> Fox's Megyn Kelly: ""We have Trump speaking to our own Sean Hannity. Let's see if he speaks to any of the journalists in the room.""

https://twitter.com/dfriedman33/status/780600035788595200"
218,1,It was like an awful SNL skit that wouldn't end.
219,4,"What in the fuck was Trump talking about at times, like it literally had fuck all to do with anything."
220,1,His birther arguments were complete gibberish. No idea what he was saying. 
221,1,omfg that last question where he started ranting about maga and then just said that he'd support her lmao
222,4,"It was pretty much what I expected. Trump would try to hide the fact he has little knowledge, but wouldn't be able to because of the one-on-one and the extra time. He wisely stayed away from ""Crooked Hillary"", but his sighs (remember Al Gore?) and constant interjections looked bad.

That last weird bit about ""I could say something mean but I won't"" did not make you look good Donald. "
223,1,[deleted]
224,1,"You could just tell how happy she was to have a chance to say that. Someone else guessed that every time she smiled while donald talked, she had already prepared a counterpoint, and I think they were right."
225,1,"Can you even imagine being her and hearing such horrible sexist shit about why you're unfit to be president? You don't look the part, you're mentally incompetent, etc... Glad she was able to respond to that garbagw"
226,1,she spent his time talking either smiling or looking like [this](http://67.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mb8x9iiu8q1rbzx9io2_1280.jpg)
227,2,For real. Dude can't even do a 90 minute debate
228,1,The cocaine was wearing off towards the end and he was just getting cranky. 
229,1,"It's clearly Adderall, but yeah."
230,1,He's a creature of the 80s. I don't really think he was on coke but it wouldn't surprise me if he was because he felt he needed that old reliable boost. 
231,1,"He petered out about halfway through. It was quite amusing, you could see him get tired and frustrated."
232,1,"She did drop some sick burns tonight, not gonna lie. I don't support either of them, but man that was just wow."
233,1,that and the tweet quote were strong ones
234,3,"She definitely used her best zingers, like a greatest hits. That one, and ""the only secret is he has no plan.""  Hopefully her team comes up with new ones for the next debate. I agree with Trump that it's getting old almost as much as I agree with Hillary that it's a good one."
235,4,"Clinton basically apologising the world for Trump was actually funny, but him saying America shouldn't be a world police is also smart, but then he rambled forever"
236,3,"Well, with the debate ending, holy shit. I think Trump started off okay, but as time went on he seemed to really come unraveled. By the end I felt like I was watching a murder with the whole ""Ms. Piggy"" thing."
237,1,Hopefully undecideds watched the whole thing 
238,1,We did! We're decided now.
239,1,I did. And now I'm not.
240,1,"[deleted]  
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.6338 
 > [What is this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/57407)"
241,4,"Yeah, the opening handshake was good.  Then he greeted Hillary, and it was all downhill from there."
242,3,"Condescendingly asking if he could call her Secretary Clinton, and then using the word secretary in a seemingly pejorative sense throughout the debate made me angry. But Hillary's constant calm, earnest and cool attitude settled me down."
243,0,"Listen, I am as luke-warm about Hillary as anyone but can we please put the whole ""she doesn't discuss policy, it's all about I'm not Trump"" shit to bed? She seemed to be making a concerted effort to keep it about specific policy while Trump regurgitated his ""Make America Great Again"" and ""It is all China's fault"" rants."
244,4,"So some of my personal highlights from Trump's dumpster fire performance:

* Claims that not paying any federal tax makes him smart thereby admitting he doesn't pay any federal tax.

* Claims he will release all his taxes as soon as his audit is finished, followed immediately by claims he has been under audit for 15 years.

* When confronted with accusations that he didn't pay an architect for designing one of his clubhouses he defends it because ""maybe he wasn't happy with the work done"".

* Claims that stop and frisk wasn't ruled unconstitutional, then blames the ruling on an anti-police judge.

* Claims he is not racist because he settled an anti-discrimination lawsuit out of court, and then brags that it was easy to do.

* Claims that he was doing a service to Obama by forcing him to produce his birth certificate.

* Spends 5 minutes on an unstoppable, and fiery, rant about how claims he was a supporter of the invasion of Iraq are wrong, and within 30 seconds of ending claims that he has the best temperament.

* Claims that shooting an Iranian navy ship for taunting US ships wouldn't start a war.

I'm sure there are plenty more but these were the main ones that come to mind. That was an absolute disaster for Trump. He would've been better just not showing up and letting Clinton debate an empty podium."
245,1,"Some more highlights:

* Criticizing Clinton for not being polite enough to President Obama during the 2008 Primary Debates

* Congratulating himself for not being as big of an asshole as he could have been (""I could have said some real nasty stuff about Hillary"")

* Claiming that Clinton has been fighting ISIS ""as long as she's been alive"" and seemingly holding her personally accountable for every single bad thing that has happened in the USA in the last 30 years

* Says that China or Iran should take military action against North Korea

* Says that he - the man running for president of the United States - doesn't think very much about NATO, the military alliance that's one of the cornerstones of our foreign policy

* Imploring Lester Holt and the audience to ""call Sean Hannity"" about his support of the Iraq war, as if what he said privately to a fringe-right talk show host is more important than his public statements in favor of the war"
246,1,The ole Clint Eastwood method lol
247,4,"Ay one point Trump said (I'm paraphrasing) ""I've had great relationships with African Americans over the years"" which to me is another way of saying ""I've got black friends."" Implying he can't be racist. My dad got mad when I pointed that out to him."
248,4,"I know a lot of people are going to complain about Lester being a pushover.  But I honestly think that he didn't have a choice.  If Lester tried to take control he would have been attacked as being pro-hillary and biased against Trump.  Since one of the big takeaways is going to be how Lester lost control of the debate, I think that will allow the moderators to be more direct in the next 2 debates"
249,1,Lester was letting him hang himself. He knew what he was doing.
250,1,"""Not paying federal taxes makes me smart""' your potential next president America.

I can't believe a person running for president could say that and still have a good chance of winning. Wtf?

Edit: A word"
251,1,He literally can't separate his business from his candidacy. It's such a frightening thought.
252,4,"Trump said he has a winning temperament, but interrupting both Hillary and Holt about ten times a minute says otherwise."
253,0,"Lester/Hillary: ""here's a fact""

Trump: *sniff* ""WRONG"""
254,1,That sniffing was pretty annoying.
255,1,"I lost my shit during this, I couldn't keep a straight face "
256,2,The crowd laughing at that was by far my favorite part of the debate.
257,4,The crowd kinda went back and forth with cheers and then Trump got laughed at and really I think that's when the election ended.
258,1,"> that's when the election ended.

or so we hope and pray"
259,1,"Exactly, hes so smart and composed, best temperament.  Yet cant stay on point, does nothing but rambles, interrupts and mocks.  Absolute shit show of a performance and I can't understand how people support someone with such little ideas on policy and what being the President actually means. 


Trump made Mitt Romney look like fucking Obama at this point."
260,1,The laughter from the crowd when he said that tells you all you need to know about that statement.
261,1,[deleted]
262,4,"I knew it would be bad, but I didn't think it would be THAT bad. I honestly thought Clinton would just coast by and let Trump make a fool of himself, but she actually took a pretty successful, humorous, active role. He got clobbered."
263,3,"Prepared for the debate, but also prepared for being president. BAM.

She got stamina. BAM.

After this I found Hillary a lot more likable. This debate also really put a huge spotlight on how much of a horrible president Trump would be."
264,4,This is the most I've listened to Donald Trump and I cannot fathom how anyone could think he's fit for this job. 
265,1,People acting like they're equally horrible must be kidding themselves. This guy is fucking insane.
266,1,"It's because ""they're both equally bad"" requires little thought and makes you sound above the angry masses and smart. It's the new catchphrase."
267,1,[deleted]
268,1,"The funny thing is, it should've been clear months ago. 

"
269,1,[deleted]
270,2,I told a friend before the debate that there wasn't a lesser of the two evils. Now I feel like a fool. 
271,1,"That's what pisses me off about the ""they both suck"" narrative. Yeah, I donated, volunteered, and caucused for Sanders but I'd rather have the candidate who supports 90% of his platform than the candidate who wants to return us to some magical 1950s white wonderland that never existed in the first place."
272,1,He took a shot at her for being prepared. What the fuck is the rationale there?
273,1,"Yes. As a non American, please America, don't make this guy president! You might not like Hilary but I'll take the status quo over that petulant nut job. "
274,1,Jesus I never thought I'd see someone that incoherent given such a high profile stage. What a fucking idiot. Just word salad. He denigrates every American institution and he can't even get out a complete fucking sentence.
275,4,"Hillary: ""Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said, back in 2006, 'Gee I hope it does collapse because then I can go in and buy some, and make some money.' Well it did collapse.""

Trump: ""That's called business, by the way.""

Hillary: ""Nine million people, nine million people lost their jobs, five million people lost their homes, and 13 trillion dollars of family wealth was wiped out.""

One of the worst things that came out of his mouth this debate. "
276,1,"When Hilary was bringing up the fact that he paid zero dollars in federal income tax and Donald responded with ""That's called being smart"" I was floored."
277,4,"Trump ended this thing by complaining that Rosie O'Donnell said bad things about him?  If, god forbid, the man gets elected, that's like the tip of the iceberg."
278,2,"Mfw I hear the phrase ""Rosie O'Donnell"" in a presidential debate"
279,3,"Trump on this debate

""Wrong""

""Lie that's a lie""

""You not very nice""

(Massive Sniffing )


He's the the oldest middle schooler ever
"
280,1,(Sipping water when he's proven wrong)
281,1,"Something, something, Marco Rubio. "
282,1,"Even a middle schooler knows not to interrupt the other person when they are speaking.  If they're respectful, that is."
283,3,"He sounded like a bitter defendant on Judge Judy.

I kinda want her to moderate now..."
284,1,You heard the sniffles too?  I thought he was going to cry.
285,4,"Is it just me, or did Trump sound like a mafia boss, threatening to pull protection from these NATO countries if they don't pay.  ""It would be awful if something happened to your nice little country here."""
286,1,"""Sure would suck if your neighbor got nukes and we weren't defending you."""
287,4,"Living in Europe, we'll take Hillary, if you please. "
288,1,18 of the 20 undecided voters on CNN said Clinton won. 
289,1,"In Orlando Florida, to give context"
290,4,"So, as an outsider I learned in which cities Trump has property and business.

The more you know..."
291,4,"Trump running for president gives me hope that I can still do anything I want in life no matter how bad I am at it.
EDIT: seems like i'm a few million dollars short"
292,1,"Did you inherit millions and millions of dollars and have a rich politically connected parent to bail you out? If not, I've got some bad news for you...."
293,1,All you need is a small loan!
294,4,"""They gave Trump hard questions!"" At this point I feel any question is a hard question for Trump."
295,1,"""will you accept the results of this election"", god what a setup.  Fucking MSM bias amirite???"
296,4,"As a Hillary supporter, I'm surprised there weren't any questions specifically about her private server, so I think there's at least some justification for Trump supporters feeling like he got the tougher questions. That being said, he hasn't done himself any favors over the years by saying so many things that could come back to bite him in the ass."
297,0,There was one but no follow up.  That said trump should have pivoted to that during his ramblings.  
298,0,Hillary admitted she was wrong. Trump doesn't understand how that works so he had no idea how to address it.
299,4,For me Hillary won
300,1,"Was anyone else annoyed by the audience? I thought this was supposed to be strictly enforced silence, and it turned into exchanges of cheers from opposite sides of the room."
301,1,"It was annoying, but to be honest I was surprised it didn't happen more.  Over 90 minutes it wasn't very often."
302,1,"There was a comment a few days ago saying something like ""the whims of a few thousand in an auditorium shouldn't have political sway over 300 million"" and it's absolutely true"
303,3,Really annoying. Audience went out of control just like the debate with all the off-topic talk.
304,0,Trump alienated his own base by making fun of dudes who are 400 pounds.
305,1,And people who pay taxes.  They aren't smart.  
306,1,I keep screaming but God won't answer
307,4,I thought Hillary won that comfortably but then I always think that Trump is bombing when he speaks.
308,0,"Hillary got so much stronger as the debate wore on. With all the talk about stamina, she proved herself here. Trump was Trump."
309,0,It seems that Trump started out restrained but got flustered and fell back into the Trump we all know. I guess what I'm saying is he doesn't have the stamina.
310,1,"The best was when she brought the lawsuits against him for not renting to black people. All he could say was, ""I never admitted guilt"" and that many other companies were being racist too."
311,4,"Am I crazy or did Trump come off as maniacal, overly agressive, and not very knowledgeable? Tough night to watch him.

Edit: was making sure it wasn't confirmation bias. Nope. Trump faceplanted hard."
312,1,When has he not come off as such?
313,0,"Yea, I thought Trump came off as... Trump"
314,1,"""As soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates peace treaties and cease-fires, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.""

I think I heard the ""smack"" that came with that one through my computer."
315,4,"The best part. Donald Trump says he has a great temperament and the audience laughs, thinking he's making a self-deprecating joke.

HE WASN'T!"
316,1,"No, they were laughing at him because they knew he wasn't joking. "
317,4,"I felt Hillary absolutely crushed the section on race. Didn't mince any words, held to her convictions (something I was really happy to see given how rarely I find myself nodding along with her when she speaks) and made a cogent argument all at the same time. Her passion really showed there, and it was something to see.

It surprised me, to be honest. I'm a somewhat reluctant Hillary supporter, thinking she is just the lesser of 2 evils, but that section really, truly convinced me."
318,1,"People don't remember Hillary the radical leftist hippie dippie. Seriously, she was the shit back before she came out the other side of the political machine. I support her mostly based on what her core values seem to be. "
319,1,"Ding ding, that's me. I genuinely don't remember that, I'm probably too young.

My early memories are her against Obama, and I found her lacking up against the passion that he always seemed to show.

His speeches gave me goosebumps, hers made me yawn. This was one of the first times I remember being excited about something she said."
320,1,"Welcome to Actual Clinton. She's spent her entire life in the public sector, and some people are starting to realize *she actually wants to accomplish meaningful things.* There's a reason the Republican Party has done literally everything it can to shut her down."
321,1,"Fair enough, I'm excited to see it."
322,3,I can't believe the whole Global warming issue is still up for debate. It's fucking real and needs to be given priority #1.
323,2,At least it will likely come up in a portion of another debate. This debate didn't have that kind of focus in its topics 
324,4,"[Reminder for the next time a Trump supporter calls you a ""shill"".](http://i.imgur.com/p8tXLys.jpg) "
325,1,"To all the people saying, ""Trump"" didn't talk about Policy, he did. He spent like five minutes agressively advocating for unconstituonal stop and frisk."
326,1,I have property there 😂😭
327,1,They need to give the moderator the ability to cut off the mic of anyone that extends 10 seconds past his warning of time. We just listened to 30 seconds of ranting on the end of every answer.
328,4,"As an Aussie who watched this for laughs, I wouldn't say Hillary won so much as Trump lost to himself

All she had to do was stay reasonably on topic and let him choke on his own words in his follow up"
329,1,"I personally believe that was her entire plan. Plant some seeds to get him riled, then let him loose on something he knows nothing about."
330,1,"When she called him out on being racist, I actually thought she had thrown him into an infinite loop of self-justifying denial."
331,1,I really liked him talking about how proud he was of opening a non-racist club in Palm Beach.
332,3,If this debate shows anything it shows that Hillary has better temperament than Trump does.
333,1,"But he has a winning temperament, the best temperament"
334,4,But trump said so may times that he had the best temperament so how can that be true
335,4,Trump got destroyed with the stamina thing lmao
336,4,Hillary had that comeback ready for years
337,1,That was a beautiful retort
338,1,She crushed him there
339,1,He was trying to dogwhistle that she has no balls but it didn't work out. 
340,1,"He shouldn't have even tried that argument. It only would have worked if she showed any signs of fatigue, and she clearly didn't. "
341,3,The audience laughing at Trump when he said he had a better temperament than Clinton sums up this entire debate in five seconds.
342,4,"It's notable how many times Clinton gave the better answer, and then Trump basically responded with ""oh yeah, I want to do that also""."
343,0,Trump answers were so muddled. He didn't even answer questions.
344,1,I heard 2 concrete policy proposals from Trump (Stop and Frisk and take Iraq's oil) both of which are unconstitutional. One thing we learned: his 10 year old son is good at computers.
345,2,Trump kept sniffing at the beginning of the debate. My friends and I are wondering if he took a bump before the debate to get pumped up.  And the late part of the debate was him getting unraveled.  
346,1,"> Well, I’m really calling for major jobs because the wealthy are going to create tremendous jobs

That should be reason #872 no one votes for him, but alas it probably will make no difference."
347,4,"So did Barack and Hillary found ISIS a few years ago, or has she been fighting them her whole life? I'm confused. "
348,3,"Trump after the debate ""I'm proud of myself that I held back about Bill Clinton's indiscretions"". Wut? Bad move"
349,3,As soon as they mentioned stamina you knew she was going to bring up her 11 hour testimony. That was the moment of the debate. 
350,3,">""Rudolph Giuliani
‏@rudygiulianiGOP
This debate was not @realDonaldTrump's best, but there are still two more. #debatenight""

Lol, stick a fork in this thing. "
351,3,"I am a staunch Bernie supporter, but I have to admit that Hillary is growing on me a little. She went balls to the wall and Trump looked absolutely *awful*. Good god, it was like watching a college debate team dialogue with an angry toddler.

Using adjectives as nouns, repeating himself, losing composure, shouting WRONG as a rebuttal in a formal debate...

Meanwhile Hillary was composed and came out swinging with her policies and a few snappy one-liners to boot. If Trump's numbers don't tank after this, I will permanently lose faith in humanity."
352,1,"I was planning on voting for her, but I didn't really like her up until this point.

Oh my god, I can't believe how well she dealt with him. She kept talking through his interruptions and he couldn't phase her."
353,1,being a mom tends to prepare you for dealing with grumpy toddlers 
354,1,"Whatever she took before the event, I need a lifetime supply of."
355,1,It's her natural STAMINA
356,1,"Finishing words like ""cyber security"" and ""nuclear threat"". Like what the fuck was that? ""The cyber is a real issue."""
357,3,"Agreed, I was a 'I'm voting for Hillary out of fear' guy, but now, I'm starting to like her."
358,0,"Are we the same? I was on the well Hillary isn't trump train but after that, I can't help but smile after some of those one liners."
359,2,"You don't have to like her, but it's hard to admit this debate wasn't enjoyable in its own perverse way."
360,2,"I don't like either of them, but it was satisfying watching Donald act like it was the GOP debate and getting his ass handed to him."
361,4,"I said at the time how crazy the contrasts were.

Bernie and Hillary were deep in the weeds arguing over policy.

Trump and the repubs are calling each other names and comparing dick sizes.

It was insane. I still really don't know how we got here."
362,1,"to me she's kinda running on a ""4 year continuation of obama"" and im okay with the status quo"
363,1,"She's got a lot of sass, and I'm starting to admire it "
364,0,I hate trump so much I'm supporting hillary for the first time since 08
365,1,Thank Christ you guys are finally starting to come around.
366,1,This fucking year.
367,1,"WHY IS NOBODY CALLING SEAN HANNITY!



Donald is asking the questions we all wonder. "
368,4,"So Hillary owned the email server issue as a ""Mistake""

Trump fell back on an openly disproved lie about his tax returns, but ruined the point by admitting he didn't pay federal taxes at all.

How did Trump win this again?"
369,4,That was so insane that the fact Trump said bombing an Iranian ship because they were taunting Americans wouldn't start a war isn't getting mentioned anywhere...I mean.  WTF?!
370,2,"He's already denying everything he said in the debate.

Poor senile bastard."
371,3,"Oh how I wish I could see an Obama vs. Trump debate.

Trump needs the charismatic and intellectual belittling that Obama would give him."
372,3,"If you want to know who won, Here are some gold from the_donald.  ENJOY!:

""I think Trump was weak here. Definitely could have done better.""

""Trump didn't need to win. He just need not to lose.""

""He didn't want to destroy her in the first debate.""


""Guys, this is the first debate. If there's anything we've seen with Trump, it's that he never goes all in at first.""


""I don't think that was a good debate for Don. He was either on the offensive or defensive for entire questions.""


""WHY DIDN'T HE ATTACK HER... I feel so disappointed"""
373,4,"some many broken 12 yr old hearts tonight.

they thought daddy trump was gunna make the bad lady go away"
374,1,I still can't believe he insinuated that he would blackmail other countries for our protection
375,1,So did anybody call Sean Hannity?
376,1,"James Carville: ""He was just ... bad. The further it went the worse it got."""
377,1,"Mostly sounded like ranting from a crazy street person from Donald's side. ""AIRPORTS! CYBER!!! gotta fix cyber. Yeah call Hannity! HE'LL tell ya. Yeah. Hannity knows all about the Kenya thing and the Iraq. YEAH. Hannity 'il tell 'em all."" *sniffles uncontrollably*"
378,3,"Somewhere, a /r/The_Donald poster sighs heavily as he sadly crumples up his hand-made ""Hillary's Cough Count"" poster for the debate.

EDIT: Thank you for the 2x gold, I will be paying it forward with a $~~5~~ $10 donation for Hillary's campaign."
379,3,Sounds like Donald has the sniffles. Weak. And Sad! 
380,1,A common symptom of space cancer
381,1,Indicates bad stamina!
382,3,Trump drank way too much water... he clearly had to piss towards the end of that debate.
383,1,[deleted]
384,0,"Trump brags about winning the online polls.  Guess it's morning in Moscow now, Putin's boys are waking up and trolling internet polls"
385,1,[deleted]
386,4,This I the first time I've seen Trump speak that isn't short segments. Does he always meander incoherently from irrelevant point to irrelevant point without actually saying anything?
387,0,"Assuming Trump doesn't refuse to do the other debates, the moderators *need* to be able to cut the microphones. Trump can't be allowed to ramble on and on like that."
388,1,I'll be very surprised if he does another.  I'm def not a Hill fan but holy shit did he look like a clown tonight and if he has the self awareness to recognize it that's going to sting his pride something awful.
389,3,Trump is like the kid who shows up to class having not done his homework and tries to bullshit on the fly.
390,3,Seeing post debate coverage on msnbc.  Why isn't trump letting Melania speak?
391,4,"Pretty much an unmitigated disaster for Trump. I was wrong, there were low expectations, but he couldn't meet them, wasn't even close. Was incoherent and was challenged on things he usually goes unchallenged on resulting in a lot of incoherent rambling. It's not me either, Giuliani was even saying he had a bad performance. "
392,4,"I honestly don't want to antagonize here, I really just want to know. How do Trump supporters/leaning Trump react when he says things like ""no it wouldn't start a war"" in regard to advocating opening fire on foreign vessels for ""taunting"""
393,1,She said not very nice things about me cried the man who says political correctness is killing this country 
394,1,Are we going to ignore the fact that he advocated for stop and frisk on live TV after he was corrected that it was unconstitutional in NY several times? 
395,1,"Did he just say he takes advantage of the laws of this country for his interests, his company and his family?
He is done. So many sound bites for ads from this debate for the clinton camp to use in ads.
Oh, and also... did he admit he is smart for not paying tax and for cheating small business men?
Congratulations to Hillary Clinton. She did better than I expected."
396,4,"So what I got from Trump: ISIS, *sniffle*, Hillary's website, WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT?, *sniffle*, No, No, *sniffle*, ISIS, other countries are losers who should pay us, I never said that, No, ISIS."
397,3,Fuck. Trump Just told Dana Bash on CNN that he withheld talking about Bills indiscretions and that he might say it next debate. 
398,3,Hillary Clinton spent a few days prepping for the debate. Trump ignored that and just did some rails in the bathroom. The man was high on coke.
399,0,"Trump stammered on in his typical fashion. Hillary was prepared and rehearsed. Compared to his flustered ramblings and dull barbs, she definitely won."
400,1,"Well, that was something. I'm going to have a beer and pretend this didn't happen. "
401,1,Holy shit.... What the hell was that?
402,1,Jesus Christ america you can't be serious with that guy.
403,1,"Wait, so let me get this straight. Admitting to not paying federal income taxes and ""taking advantage of current laws"" makes him smart and a good business man. But American companies exporting jobs to countries with cheaper labor is what then? "
404,4,"He admitted he disrespected Rosie as a woman (called her a pig or a dog right?) and answered to this by claiming she ""deserved it"" adding no one disagrees. 

😳 

Let's add that straw to the camel's back. 

What. A. Shitshow.

Edit: [here](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/10/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-women-viciously-attacked-him-fir/) is a quick run down of his verbal tirades against women. "
405,4,"Did Trump have a cohesive answer for literally any question? Every response was some variation on ""Hillary did X."" Doesn't exactly inspire faith in his plan."
406,3,"The worst part about this is that I have no idea who ""won"" this debate in the eyes of American voters.  
To me Trump seemed like a complete disaster, but that's what I always think whenever he opens his mouth, and yet his campaign is very succesful so far.  

So I just honestly can't tell the difference, what does Trump have to say that would make him lose support?  "
407,1,Bill looks mildly disappointed there aren't any balloons to kick around.
408,0,Trump is clearly not running as a republican. It's the platform he used to get his foot in the door. 
409,1,Someone call Sean Hannity. He's just so lonely.
410,1,braggadocious.
411,3,Trump was going good at first then turned into a train wreck. I honestly couldn't imagine this debate going any better for Hillary.

415,1,"Which is such a weird thing to do in the ""Age of Never Forgetting."" Social media and the rest of the Internet is on the hunt for this shit. And it's real easy when it's on the candidate tweeted it -- in the case of Global Warming -- himself!"
416,3,"It's important to note that she gave a shout-out to S. Korea and Japan and made assurance of their alliance and treaties. 

At that moment, while Trump was defending his ego about delivering Nukes to the Korean Peninsula.. She really gave a needed reality check, and put the purpose of the debate into context. "
417,3,"I think that might be the most important part of the whole debate. No matter who you think won, in that moment, Hillary sounded like a president."
418,4,As expected we learned exactly nothing about Trump's policy. We did learn that he has property in Chicago and Charlotte and on and on. We learned he made 640 million last year. We learned he thinks it's good to profit off economic crisis. We learned he loves to brag about himself more than anything else.
419,0,"Trump produced a number of soundbites that Clinton can use effectively in the days to come.   Mark my words, this is reminiscent of the Kennedy Nixon debates.   Trump being Nixon. "
420,1,"Did Trump argue that we need stop and frisk across America, as in, the Police can stop anyone one of us without cause, and fondle us to search for illegal items for no reason? I'm not about that. "
421,0,"Ooof - Republican analysis on MSNBC:

425,4,If Trump doesn't see a massive drop in the polls after tonight then I don't think he can lose to be honest. 
426,4,"I am a politically uneducated young adult. I have yet to register to vote because I would rather vote *for* a candidate than *against* one, and I have yet to feel any strong connections toward either Hillary or Trump.

After reading/listening to highlights, I believe I would vote for Hillary because she is a politician. That's it. From my point of view, on paper, this should be the simplest election our country will ever see. I know it's not, but come on.

Hypothetically, you and your spouse have planned a date night tomorrow and you need someone to watch your child. Who do you trust more with the life of your offspring in their hands: the high school girl who is posting babysitting flyers around town, or Amanda Bynes? That's what this election feels like to me."
427,1,I hope the USDA was in the building because I just watched a fucking slaughter on TV. 
428,4,"I'm sorry, but if any of you, liberal or conservative, Hillary voter or Trump voter, think Trump did anything close to a good job you are deluded. When the audience grows to laugh after you say ""I have a good temperament"" it's pretty much GG for the night. This is Meek Mill in 2015 levels of taking an L.

Like you could take Hillary out of the equation and his exchanges with Holt are brutal enough by themselves. He was fucking babbling about ""mean attack ads"" to him by the end of it, and his responses to the few fact checks were basically ""Naw bro."""
429,3,Listening to Trump's incoherent ramblings was like listening to the worst modern jazz improvisation ever.
430,0,Hillary took it hands down. Trump looks childish at best and moronic at the worst.
431,1,Was Lester there?
432,3,18 out of 20 undecided voters in cnn focus group say clinton won the debate.  
433,1,"Lol r/the_donald thinks he did bad on purpose to ""bait her"" into the next two debates. "
434,0,"Does anyone find it ironic that Hillary, having the health scare several weeks back looked healthier, more composed, and well tuned than the high energy, anti-establishment Trump? 

Trump got some good digs in, I'll definitely admit. But for every one or two digs Trump got, HRC dug harder. It's funny, Trump's expectations were low and I think he actually was underwhelming. A babbling, incoherent mess.

I think the main take away from this night is that while many feel HRC is untrustworthy, there would much rather take someone who is ready to be POTUS than the quick to anger, unhinged candidate Trump."
435,1,braggadocious
436,0,Trump's lack of intellect is both amusing and troubling.
437,4,"Trump better avoid the media for a while, he's getting scorched all over the place.  "

Trump: Missed opportunities. Bombastic. Sloppy. Unanswered questions

442,4,I think the biggest concern for the Trump camp here is how easy it's going to be for the Dems to prepare for him in the future. He showed a hell of a lot of weak points here.
443,4,"Everything went Clintons way here... Felt like trump was going to bring the emails up again during the broader discussion of cyber security, but didn't.

Anyone catch that Clinton shimmy dance? Work that into the Shaq cat wiggle gif."
444,1,What in the hell did I just watch...
445,1,shit
446,3,"This debate made me really wish Biden had run. Yes I was a Bernie supporter, and I think Hillary did a fine job, but imagine Trump ranting over Lester and the time limit while Cool Joe just gives the camera a big white smile and a wink. A wink that won the 2016 election. "
447,3,"One thing is for certain, Lester Holt definitely lost this debate. "
448,1,A good moderator really just allows space for the candidates to be themselves
449,3,"I don't know. These guys always get walked over. And Trump is pretty rough to wrangle in a debate. But Lester made it work without cutting anyone's mic. 

Everyone said he'd be a total pushover, and I think he did alright. No one is gonna say he made the debate unfair without looking like a complete fool, and that's important. "
450,4,Here come the Triggered Trump fans
451,3,"Trump blew up in the end talking about Iraq War and Sean Hannity

Cost him the debate"
452,1,"2 things that will get lost in the storm :

1) He said Hillary has been fighting ISIS her entire adult life? 

2) He went ahead and said it's OK to not pay contractors if they ""do a bad job"" "
453,4,"> 1) He said Hillary has been fighting ISIS her entire adult life?

Yeah this shows he has 0 understanding of what ISIS is or how it was formed. "
454,1,3) He thinks opening a business that doesn't discriminate is an achievement.
455,2,"Gee CANT WAIT for Pence/Kaine debate, its gonna be so LIT /s
"
456,1,"Little early for the postgame thread. 

Saints are only down 10"
457,4,Trump proved today by being uncivil and factually incorrect (adding on the that massive list) that he is a poor fit for president.
458,4,Clinton stayed calm and Trump rambled on and on and looked like a child out there. Clinton won this substantially
459,4,"Did trump answer one question all night? 

What will you do to help middle class Americans? Government is bad and Hillary sucks x7. Next question"
460,4,"""There are so many things we need to be better at, and cyber is one of them."" -Donald J. Trump "
461,4,Trump throwing out threats to Clinton about dropping stuff about her  family. Yeah that's going to work.
462,3,These trump pundits are reaching so hard to show trump won the debate. 
463,4,"One thing that stuck out to me in Trump's rhetoric was that any time he mentioned being worried about a certain place where people were suffering or in trouble, he would throw in that he holds some place of business there, as if that matters one iota. I don't understand what he could gain from mentioning that. "
464,1,"Oh guys did you hear that? Its not nice! Its not nice that ""Crooked Hilary"" has done this!"
465,4,"trump started fine, then went back to his crazy self of repeating the same shit over and over. Clinton was her boring self as always which i dont think is bad"
466,4,"paraphrasing here but:

Clinton: ""Trump has not released his tax returns because it probably shows that he's paid nothing in federal income tax""

Trump interrupting: ""that makes me very smart""

Clinton: ""Which means he's paid ZERO to support our troops, help our veterans, and help educate our children""

472,4,My favorite moment was when the audience LOLed when Trump said he has the best temperament
473,1,"I posted about this in the [megathread during the debate,](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/54nnyo/2016_presidential_race_first_presidential_debate/d83l15f) but figure I should post about it here.

Trump made so many flubs and mistakes in the debate. It was pretty hard to keep count. But the biggest one in my opinion was how he buckled down on wanting to blow up an Iranian sailing vessel for taunting us.

TO SHOOT AT ANOTHER VESSEL IS AN ACT OF WAR. That will definitely start a war. And a war with a power that, if they don't currently have nuclear weapons, was at least 2 steps away from having them. 

And we started a [war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish%E2%80%93American_War#USS_Maine) over similar actions. [Twice.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_incident#Consequences)

I also like how he apparently has not commented on Russia doing [similar actions to our naval vessels](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/18/politics/russia-jets-buzz-u-s-ship-rules-of-engagement/) in open waters. And [our airplanes.](http://www.businessinsider.com/ap-navy-boss-russian-jets-should-stop-buzzing-us-planes-ship-2016-5) 

But no, lets start yet another war because of bruised egos. It isn't like [we grandstand all the damn time.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_evil)"
474,1,nato isnt paying their fair share.  neither is donald.  clinton needs to keep hitting him on that  
475,4,Easily a loss for Trump there. He actually said he mightn't have paid his workers because they didn't do a good job... So many easy soundbites for the Clinton campaign on this one. 
476,1,"Oh my God. On C-SPANthey showed a tweet that said ""You're fucking retarded."" uncensored.  Hahahahahah"
477,0,Trump gonna trump.....his base is well oiled but I can't imagine he picked up many votes tonight.

Our **post debate poll finds voters think Hillary Clinton won 51-40**. Full results coming in next half hour"
481,0,Anyone see that trump tantrum on MSNBC?
482,4,"Trump saying his winning asset being his temperment is like the Oakland Raiders saying their winning asset is their penalty yardage. Regardless of how you feel about Trump, I have a hard time believing anyone would honestly agree with him on that particular sentiment"
483,4,"""When they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should of included, the fact that, they do something with respect to North Korea. They should of done something with respect to Yemen, and all these other places"" - I think Trump has finally revealed his secret foreign policy plan, get Iran to do everything."
484,4,"Hillary won for sure.
Still can't stand her though.
God I'm gonna have to hold my nose this time around aren't I?"
485,1,Hilary spent her entire adult life fighting Isis. Now that's  stamina.
486,3,Trump definitely lost this debate. 
487,1,"He kept slipping until he finally torpedoed himself by going after Lester then capping it with ""I have the best temperament""."
488,4,"This really made me think Trump doesn't know what he is doing. Trump has been focus grouped widely and he is constantly referred to as unstable and impulsive. This is a flaw of his that some voters dont mind because they prefer his out of the box thinking and genuine style. Those are his strengths and weaknesses.


When he says ""I have the best temperament"" he just says something that voters know isn't true. He is talking as if he doesn't know or didn't study what voters think if him."
489,1,Clinton was savage tonight. She let him dig his own hole. And boy did he keep digging
490,1,After his longest rant I swear she sighed a sigh of relief.
491,1,That hole just got 10ft deeper. 
492,1,"The fact check was his worst nightmare, it seems"
493,4,"Yeah, he was pretty weak throughout. Hell, even if you were a Trump supporter I don't see how you could think he was strong in this."
494,1,Because facts don't matter.
495,1,I trust they'll find a way on /r/The_Donald.
496,1,He was on defense nearly the ENTIRE TIME.  Absolutely brutal.
497,1,He got demolished. The birth certificate discussion was a disaster.
498,1,"He wasn't even apologetic, he was glad to tell us all about how he was the one to get Obama to release his birth certificate and that blacks and Obama should be thanking him.  When he said that he helped the black community by forcing Obama to release his birth certificate my jaw was on the floor.  "
499,1,"and then claimed it's good business

i'm amazed he has any support since most of his support is poor and middle class white men, the exact people who get screwed when the rich don't pay taxes"
500,1,"It's because he's smart.  And wanting the real estate market to dive in 2006 was just good business.

Oh, and 'Bigly.'"
501,1,There goes that Reddit vote.
502,1,"Considering how popular Fat People Hate was, there's at least a portion who's sticking around."
503,1,That's the voat vote. 
504,1,Chris Christie. As it was said on CBCNN.
505,4,"That whole tangent about how he built a resort in Palm Beach or whatever so he can't be racist made so little sense it made my head spin. He just tries to shoe horn in bullshit to make him seem successful at every possible opportunity. And then he said Palm Beach was the wealthiest place in the world, which is not even close, it's not even in the top 100 wealthiest places in the US. Trump loves to exaggerate his wealth and apparently everybody else's too. I don't believe for a second he's actually a billionaire. "
506,1,"A guy who cheated on his first wife, married his mistress, then divorced her, and is currently on wife #3. He really is stunning in his lack of self awareness. "
507,4,"So far in this election cycle, Trump has been caught redhanded doing the exact things he's been accusing Hillary of doing. Hes the king of projection. Makes me think he is having some serious health issues himself."
508,1,My favorite was when he basically told Hilary that she wasn't nice. Like... has he heard anything he's said in the past year?
509,1,Well keep in mind he's also very proud that he started an establishment in Palm Beach that allowed black people.
510,4,"Hillary would've responded ""says the man on his third wife"""
511,1,"""... who had infamously cheated on his first wife.""

IIRC, he cheated on his second wife too but it was certainly big news when he cheated on his first because he married the woman he had the affair with (a young model) shortly after divorcing his wife who was a celebrity herself."
512,1,How can he possibly think bringing up that is a GOOD tactic??! 
513,3,"ya that comment was gross.  said he had some bad things to say about bill clinton, and that hes proud he held back, but maybe youll see at the 2nd debate.  dude is trailer park trash."
514,1,They need to cut mics. Enforce time limits and treat them like children if they need to.
515,3,YES. Why did they not cut off the microphones during their 2 minute speeches? The media didn't want the debate; they wanted the entertainment.
516,1,The candidates would never agree to it.
517,1,"""Please only 20 seconds"" is the funniest thing that was said all night"
518,1,I had to just break out in laughter at that point. Question is about black inequality and says he supports stop and frisk.  Forget about if he's right or not that it will help black communities. Just the fact that he actually thought he would be able to **gain black support** by endorsing **stop and frisk** of all things shows the immeasurable disconnect he has with the black community.
519,1,"When he said this in response to bridging the racial devide I was stunned, actually stunned. Voices went all charlie browns parents for a moment as I let that moment sink in... it's one of the most out of touch responses I've seen... It almost has comedic timing with how confidently it defies comprehension."
520,1,"I didn't think he could do anything to give Clinton more of the black vote, but Stop and Frisk was struck down as Unconstitutional for a reason. He's just so out of touch...."
521,1,My understanding is that he is out of touch on all levels. He should have stayed in the shadows and continued to pay politicians to do his bidding. He would have had auch better shot at having influence and power in government. 
522,1,He's not trying to gain the black vote; it's more dog whistling to his white base.
523,1,"Well he's built very, very good relationships with them over............the last little while. "
524,1,"Yeah, the people in the Harlem bar where I was watching--you know, the ones actually subjected to it--applauded that part. They also loved hearing that they couldn't walk in their own neighborhood without getting shot. (/s for anyone who needs it)"
525,1,"Even funnier, I think he just said ""cyber"", without the security part, similar to what he did with ""nuclear"" later on."
526,1,Well what do you expect? Cyber is a very bigly problem.  /s
527,1,Security is the most important part of Cyber.

561,4,"I mean I'm not surprised that he's such a big baby

I bet he would nuke the whole Middle East if a single government official in Pakistan said something bad about him (yes, I know Pakistan isn't in the Middle East, but Trump sure as shit doesn't)"
562,3,I think that line is going to be replayed ad nauseam for the next couple of days until the next debate
563,1,"I think the profiting from he housing crisis as being ""good business"" or ""smart business"" or whatever he said is going to be the takeaway

564,1,"or the fucking comment on the first strike

or how he had nothing to say on race relations but ""we need law and order"" and his promotion of stop and frisk"
565,1,"He basically admitted to not paying taxes, not paying staff and contractors, etc. What a mess. "
566,2,"Not only that, he compounded it when later in the debate he talked about nations in NATO  not paying their fair share, under treaty, under contract. Does he realize the contradiction?"
567,4,"If cornered, his campaign (probably Conway, I don't know if Trump will actually answer) will respond by saying that it's showing that they're smart to take advantage of us. 

We've been ""dumb"" so far by letting them do so. 

(Not my views, just how I anticipate them responding)"
568,1,The weird part was when he said he was gonna say something really disrespectful toward Hillary and her family but decided not to cause he realized it was mean.

581,1,Can't wait for the Southpark episode on this!
582,3,"I appreciate this. First year I registered to vote, and the first time I have seen a presidential debate. Even with that said, I knew it would go this way with Trump's demeanor. "
583,0,*Trump's temperament 
584,1,"Every time I wonder what people in other countries think about this shit show of an election, I become embarrassed."
585,1,"Oh, we of other countries don't look at this election so scornfully or mockingly, but rather in shock and disbelief. Either the majority of the US voters has lost  their rootin tootin minds or the US has ceased being a functional democracy. Both scenarios are grim :/"
586,1,"Thank you, I'm young and that was a useful perspective-check."
587,1,"I'd recommend watching either the '08 or '12 debates, then weep at what democracy has lost."
588,2,"I like the combo of debate 1 and 2 of '12. It shows Obama getting beat pretty handedly but still staying composed. Then regrouping and  having a great showing in the second debate. 

Trump was crushed in this debate but somehow I doubt he will learn from it, work hard to prepare for the next one, and come out ready to battle."
589,4,"I think there is a very good discussion to be had over the role of the government.

But that is not what we received here tonight from Trump. Other elections are much much better."
590,3,It's so fucking crazy. I honestly though Mitt sounded like a crazy robot during his debates and cringed at half of his stuff (binders full of women). But now...now Romney seems like serious candidate. 
591,0,"Romney was rich and somewhat disconnected, but he was largely a normal person with proper manners. Trump doesn't have any manners at all. No sense of what constitutes polite discourse. "
592,1,"No, no, you misunderstand. That's just for *inner city folk*. You know... *Urban people*. \*wink*"
593,1,I don't even know what he was trying to say with that. It was a total non-sequitur. 
594,1,"I still liked, ""I can deal with cybersecurity because, look i have a 10 year old son, he's great with computers, you wouldn't even believe.""
 
Ok......"
595,1,"Imagine the confusion of being that kid right now. 

""What does he mean? Am I in charge of cyber intelligence now? Wtf dad?"""
596,1,This kid can make a minecraft house in ten minutes. Obviously the best at what he does
597,1,Nerd!!!! I mean do we really want someone who is smart and does their own research about the issues? I want someone I can drink a beer with God dammit!!!!!
598,1,"Just like basically every criticism of Hillary. If there's something good to say about her, then its really bad somehow."
599,2,It's almost like it's important to prepare for a debate in front of millions. 
600,1,"They're getting overtime for sure, no ones sleeping tonight. "
601,4,"Trump tonight:

http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/sometimes-i-start-a-sentence.jpg"
602,1,"Didn't he say something about ""No it won't"" when Hilary mention that it would start a war by bombing the sailors?

I hope I didn't hear it wrong, beacuse I laughed so much xD"
603,1,"Yes. Yes he did. As if major conflicts, world wars even, were never started as the result of one nations firing on another's warships or transports.

Edit: words n' stuff"
604,1,Oh yeah!  Absolutely fucking unreal.  
605,0,"Remember the gulf of Tonkin incident?

Trump doesn't. "
606,1,"Listen, trust me. We have to assisnate Franz Ferdinand. It totally won't start a war. Trust me."
607,1,"Come now.  When has attacking a boat ever started a war lol


(You know, other than America in WW1, Spanish American war, Pearl Harbor, War of 1812, and Vietnam). "
608,1,"""That wouldn't start a war"" WTF attacking another country would clearly start a war. "
609,1,"Oh please.   The United States of America has only gone to war like, three, *maybe* four times tops, due to a civilian ship being destroyed by a foreign government. 

(It's something like that right? I'm a Canadian but there was that Spanish war ship, the Lusitania for WWI, was Gulf of Tonkin a civilian ship?, and I feel like I'm missing some big one somewhere)."
610,1,When Mr Bigly told the moderator that Stop and Frisk wasn't ruled unconsitutional I laughed for a minute and then sighed deeply.
611,1,He was told it was unconstitutional... then KEPT ON using it as his main policy proposal. That was like Marco Rubio levels of rote memorization with no thinking on his feet.
612,1,"Not to mention him trying to deny that the murder rate in NYC continued to decline past 500/yr. It literally took me 30 seconds to look that up and prove he was lying: http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_statistics/cs-en-us-city.pdf

I'm honestly trying to be open to his ideas but he just keeps spewing so much bullshit it's hard to take anything he says seriously."
613,1,As a response to a question about race relations.  
614,0,my mom is a hardcore trump supporter but acknowledged his performance as terrible before turning it off early. lol
615,4,"I think people like a winner. If the narrative in the media is that Trump lost, people who don't follow politics closely will begin to see Hillary as the inevitable winner and next president. Debates are never about specifics on the macro level. They are about momentum, and right now Hillary has it all. "
616,1,"What about the violence in Charlotte?

I own property there, too."
617,1,"Yes it was.  He also said he didn't pay any federal tax ""because I'm smart"".
"
618,1,Before this he even said he was smart for avoiding paying taxes.
619,1,"""Not nice!""

At least he'll get the toddler vote"
620,4,I think Trump was more of his own worse enemy. Getting into the birther thing and the Rosie thing he should of just moved on instead of going into those.
621,1,"He can't help himself, he's so fucking petty - temperamentally unfit for office. "
622,1,"That's not true, he has the best temperament. A winning temperament. "
623,1,Didn't he say something like we all agree Rosie deserved it? 
624,1,She should have pointed out how making corporations stay in the country is technically a regulation.
625,0,"The smartest decision was not even saying anything about Trump's Sanders comment. 

"
626,4,"He went from calling her Secy. Clinton to just Hillary.  She definitely got under his skin, but then agsin, it's so very thin, it was expected. "
627,1,Usually they are asked to stay silent so they are a non-factor.  I think its mostly for show 
628,1,They were asked to stay silent. They just didn't.
629,3,"I loved how sarcastic Hillary got. It was fantastic. I wanted ice queen Clinton to show up to the debate, but I think I actually like aloof, no-fucks-given, sarcastic Clinton more."
630,1,"Her ""it's a good line"" was fucking fantastic. "
631,1,"he denied his comments on global warming, on women and black people, on the Iraq war, on Libya, and all of those are so easily verified

the only people who think he won or got anything other than annihilated are idiots on /r/the_donald who refuse to fact check "
632,1,Wrong /s
633,3,"He won the debate for her. When the moderator says you made a comment, you better be pretty sure before you challenge it. Chances are you'll look like an idiot."
634,1,Especially when you start arguing with a black man about the racist policies that were Stop and Frisk.  
635,1,"I was only listening to it on NPR, didn't know he was black. That makes it much more interesting."
636,4,"Yea, Lester Holt, the moderator, is a black man.  And he's a registered republican.  So it was especially fascinating when Trump accused him last week of being a democrat.  But then even more fascinating was that his campaign defended this error by saying that Trump didn't know that Holt was a republican, which of course begs the question as to how did Trump assume that Holt was a democrat? Because he's black? "
637,1,because his supporters are goldfish with no memory or motivation to look it up and just believe him when he says he didn't say those things 
638,1,"This is patently false. Goldfish have perfectly average memory capabilities, and can even differentiate their owners/caretakers from other humans."
639,1,"My apologies to goldfish, lets say I was referring to the healthy cracker snack"
640,3,"Hillary saying that yes, she did prepare for the debate, ""and I also prepared to become President of the United States"" was savage."
641,1,That was the knock-out punch.  Everything after that was him trying to get back up. 
642,1,One liner of the whole night for sure
643,3,I think it's more like the teacher vs a kid whose cheat notes written on his hand got smudged.
644,1,"""I have nothing better to offer you"" was pretty loud and clear."
645,1,"If there's one thing black people love most, it's being unconstitutionally stopped and searched by police officers simply because of their skin color.

They're also on board with Iran invading North Korea, I heard."
646,1,"On top of that, he's also touting the biggest tax cut in history.  So, how exactly will we be fixing that infrastructure?

"
647,1,[deleted]
648,1,"Don't forget that he responded an accusation of taking advantage of the 2008 crisis to rip off people with ""it's business"". So not only is he proud of cheating taxes, he's also proud of making his money at the expense of others. "
649,1,[deleted]
650,4,This is the statement that will define why Hillary wins in November.
651,1,Nothing will lose him their vote.
652,1,"""hey guys he gave us a shout out"""
653,1,[You're not even kidding](http://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/54ol3s/postdebate_magathread_another_win_for_trump_are/d83mt26)
654,1,Because they're not old enough to vote.
655,1,Cheetos were spilled.  
656,1,I absolutely lost my shit when he said that.
657,3,That's also like half of /pol/
658,1,I just did a Peter Lorre laugh
659,3,">Donald was rude, disrespectful, and at times full of total BS. 

Kind of like how he's been for his entire campaign."
660,1,His birther arguments were complete gibberish. No idea what he was saying. 
661,1,omfg that last question where he started ranting about maga and then just said that he'd support her lmao
662,1,"You could just tell how happy she was to have a chance to say that. Someone else guessed that every time she smiled while donald talked, she had already prepared a counterpoint, and I think they were right."
663,1,"Can you even imagine being her and hearing such horrible sexist shit about why you're unfit to be president? You don't look the part, you're mentally incompetent, etc... Glad she was able to respond to that garbagw"
664,1,she spent his time talking either smiling or looking like [this](http://67.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mb8x9iiu8q1rbzx9io2_1280.jpg)
665,2,For real. Dude can't even do a 90 minute debate
666,1,The cocaine was wearing off towards the end and he was just getting cranky. 
667,1,"It's clearly Adderall, but yeah."
668,1,He's a creature of the 80s. I don't really think he was on coke but it wouldn't surprise me if he was because he felt he needed that old reliable boost. 
669,1,"He petered out about halfway through. It was quite amusing, you could see him get tired and frustrated."
670,1,"She did drop some sick burns tonight, not gonna lie. I don't support either of them, but man that was just wow."
671,1,that and the tweet quote were strong ones
672,3,"She definitely used her best zingers, like a greatest hits. That one, and ""the only secret is he has no plan.""  Hopefully her team comes up with new ones for the next debate. I agree with Trump that it's getting old almost as much as I agree with Hillary that it's a good one."
673,4,"Clinton basically apologising the world for Trump was actually funny, but him saying America shouldn't be a world police is also smart, but then he rambled forever"
674,1,Hopefully undecideds watched the whole thing 
675,1,We did! We're decided now.
676,1,I did. And now I'm not.
677,1,"[deleted]  
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.6338 
 > [What is this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/57407)"
678,4,"Yeah, the opening handshake was good.  Then he greeted Hillary, and it was all downhill from there."
679,3,"Condescendingly asking if he could call her Secretary Clinton, and then using the word secretary in a seemingly pejorative sense throughout the debate made me angry. But Hillary's constant calm, earnest and cool attitude settled me down."
680,1,"Some more highlights:

* Criticizing Clinton for not being polite enough to President Obama during the 2008 Primary Debates

* Congratulating himself for not being as big of an asshole as he could have been (""I could have said some real nasty stuff about Hillary"")

* Claiming that Clinton has been fighting ISIS ""as long as she's been alive"" and seemingly holding her personally accountable for every single bad thing that has happened in the USA in the last 30 years

* Says that China or Iran should take military action against North Korea

* Says that he - the man running for president of the United States - doesn't think very much about NATO, the military alliance that's one of the cornerstones of our foreign policy

* Imploring Lester Holt and the audience to ""call Sean Hannity"" about his support of the Iraq war, as if what he said privately to a fringe-right talk show host is more important than his public statements in favor of the war"
681,1,The ole Clint Eastwood method lol
682,4,"Ay one point Trump said (I'm paraphrasing) ""I've had great relationships with African Americans over the years"" which to me is another way of saying ""I've got black friends."" Implying he can't be racist. My dad got mad when I pointed that out to him."
683,1,Lester was letting him hang himself. He knew what he was doing.
684,1,He literally can't separate his business from his candidacy. It's such a frightening thought.
685,0,"Lester/Hillary: ""here's a fact""

Trump: *sniff* ""WRONG"""
686,1,That sniffing was pretty annoying.
687,1,"I lost my shit during this, I couldn't keep a straight face "
688,2,The crowd laughing at that was by far my favorite part of the debate.
689,4,The crowd kinda went back and forth with cheers and then Trump got laughed at and really I think that's when the election ended.
690,1,"> that's when the election ended.

or so we hope and pray"
691,1,"Exactly, hes so smart and composed, best temperament.  Yet cant stay on point, does nothing but rambles, interrupts and mocks.  Absolute shit show of a performance and I can't understand how people support someone with such little ideas on policy and what being the President actually means. 


Trump made Mitt Romney look like fucking Obama at this point."
692,1,The laughter from the crowd when he said that tells you all you need to know about that statement.
693,1,[deleted]
694,3,"Prepared for the debate, but also prepared for being president. BAM.

She got stamina. BAM.

After this I found Hillary a lot more likable. This debate also really put a huge spotlight on how much of a horrible president Trump would be."
695,1,"It's because ""they're both equally bad"" requires little thought and makes you sound above the angry masses and smart. It's the new catchphrase."
696,1,[deleted]
697,1,"The funny thing is, it should've been clear months ago. 

"
698,1,[deleted]
699,2,I told a friend before the debate that there wasn't a lesser of the two evils. Now I feel like a fool. 
700,1,"That's what pisses me off about the ""they both suck"" narrative. Yeah, I donated, volunteered, and caucused for Sanders but I'd rather have the candidate who supports 90% of his platform than the candidate who wants to return us to some magical 1950s white wonderland that never existed in the first place."
701,1,He took a shot at her for being prepared. What the fuck is the rationale there?
702,1,"Yes. As a non American, please America, don't make this guy president! You might not like Hilary but I'll take the status quo over that petulant nut job. "
703,1,"When Hilary was bringing up the fact that he paid zero dollars in federal income tax and Donald responded with ""That's called being smart"" I was floored."
704,2,"Mfw I hear the phrase ""Rosie O'Donnell"" in a presidential debate"
705,1,(Sipping water when he's proven wrong)
706,1,"Something, something, Marco Rubio. "
707,1,"Even a middle schooler knows not to interrupt the other person when they are speaking.  If they're respectful, that is."
708,3,"He sounded like a bitter defendant on Judge Judy.

I kinda want her to moderate now..."
709,1,You heard the sniffles too?  I thought he was going to cry.
710,1,"""Sure would suck if your neighbor got nukes and we weren't defending you."""
711,4,"Living in Europe, we'll take Hillary, if you please. "
712,1,"In Orlando Florida, to give context"
713,1,"Did you inherit millions and millions of dollars and have a rich politically connected parent to bail you out? If not, I've got some bad news for you...."
714,1,All you need is a small loan!
715,1,"""will you accept the results of this election"", god what a setup.  Fucking MSM bias amirite???"
716,4,"As a Hillary supporter, I'm surprised there weren't any questions specifically about her private server, so I think there's at least some justification for Trump supporters feeling like he got the tougher questions. That being said, he hasn't done himself any favors over the years by saying so many things that could come back to bite him in the ass."
717,0,There was one but no follow up.  That said trump should have pivoted to that during his ramblings.  
718,0,Hillary admitted she was wrong. Trump doesn't understand how that works so he had no idea how to address it.
719,1,"It was annoying, but to be honest I was surprised it didn't happen more.  Over 90 minutes it wasn't very often."
720,1,"There was a comment a few days ago saying something like ""the whims of a few thousand in an auditorium shouldn't have political sway over 300 million"" and it's absolutely true"
721,3,Really annoying. Audience went out of control just like the debate with all the off-topic talk.
722,1,And people who pay taxes.  They aren't smart.  
723,0,"Hillary got so much stronger as the debate wore on. With all the talk about stamina, she proved herself here. Trump was Trump."
724,0,It seems that Trump started out restrained but got flustered and fell back into the Trump we all know. I guess what I'm saying is he doesn't have the stamina.
725,1,"The best was when she brought the lawsuits against him for not renting to black people. All he could say was, ""I never admitted guilt"" and that many other companies were being racist too."
726,1,When has he not come off as such?
727,0,"Yea, I thought Trump came off as... Trump"
728,1,"No, they were laughing at him because they knew he wasn't joking. "
729,1,"People don't remember Hillary the radical leftist hippie dippie. Seriously, she was the shit back before she came out the other side of the political machine. I support her mostly based on what her core values seem to be. "
730,1,"Ding ding, that's me. I genuinely don't remember that, I'm probably too young.

My early memories are her against Obama, and I found her lacking up against the passion that he always seemed to show.

His speeches gave me goosebumps, hers made me yawn. This was one of the first times I remember being excited about something she said."
731,1,"Welcome to Actual Clinton. She's spent her entire life in the public sector, and some people are starting to realize *she actually wants to accomplish meaningful things.* There's a reason the Republican Party has done literally everything it can to shut her down."
732,1,"Fair enough, I'm excited to see it."
733,2,At least it will likely come up in a portion of another debate. This debate didn't have that kind of focus in its topics 
734,1,"I personally believe that was her entire plan. Plant some seeds to get him riled, then let him loose on something he knows nothing about."
735,1,"When she called him out on being racist, I actually thought she had thrown him into an infinite loop of self-justifying denial."
736,1,I really liked him talking about how proud he was of opening a non-racist club in Palm Beach.
737,1,"But he has a winning temperament, the best temperament"
738,4,But trump said so may times that he had the best temperament so how can that be true
739,4,Hillary had that comeback ready for years
740,1,That was a beautiful retort
741,1,She crushed him there
742,1,He was trying to dogwhistle that she has no balls but it didn't work out. 
743,1,"He shouldn't have even tried that argument. It only would have worked if she showed any signs of fatigue, and she clearly didn't. "
744,1,"I was planning on voting for her, but I didn't really like her up until this point.

Oh my god, I can't believe how well she dealt with him. She kept talking through his interruptions and he couldn't phase her."
745,1,being a mom tends to prepare you for dealing with grumpy toddlers 
746,1,"Whatever she took before the event, I need a lifetime supply of."
747,1,It's her natural STAMINA
748,1,"Finishing words like ""cyber security"" and ""nuclear threat"". Like what the fuck was that? ""The cyber is a real issue."""
749,3,"Agreed, I was a 'I'm voting for Hillary out of fear' guy, but now, I'm starting to like her."
750,0,"Are we the same? I was on the well Hillary isn't trump train but after that, I can't help but smile after some of those one liners."
751,2,"You don't have to like her, but it's hard to admit this debate wasn't enjoyable in its own perverse way."
752,2,"I don't like either of them, but it was satisfying watching Donald act like it was the GOP debate and getting his ass handed to him."
753,4,"I said at the time how crazy the contrasts were.

Bernie and Hillary were deep in the weeds arguing over policy.

Trump and the repubs are calling each other names and comparing dick sizes.

It was insane. I still really don't know how we got here."
754,1,"to me she's kinda running on a ""4 year continuation of obama"" and im okay with the status quo"
755,1,"She's got a lot of sass, and I'm starting to admire it "
756,0,I hate trump so much I'm supporting hillary for the first time since 08
757,1,Thank Christ you guys are finally starting to come around.
758,4,"some many broken 12 yr old hearts tonight.

they thought daddy trump was gunna make the bad lady go away"
759,3,Sounds like Donald has the sniffles. Weak. And Sad! 
760,1,A common symptom of space cancer
761,1,Indicates bad stamina!
762,3,Trump drank way too much water... he clearly had to piss towards the end of that debate.
763,1,I'll be very surprised if he does another.  I'm def not a Hill fan but holy shit did he look like a clown tonight and if he has the self awareness to recognize it that's going to sting his pride something awful.
764,1,"Which is such a weird thing to do in the ""Age of Never Forgetting."" Social media and the rest of the Internet is on the hunt for this shit. And it's real easy when it's on the candidate tweeted it -- in the case of Global Warming -- himself!"
765,3,"I think that might be the most important part of the whole debate. No matter who you think won, in that moment, Hillary sounded like a president."
766,1,A good moderator really just allows space for the candidates to be themselves
767,3,"I don't know. These guys always get walked over. And Trump is pretty rough to wrangle in a debate. But Lester made it work without cutting anyone's mic. 

Everyone said he'd be a total pushover, and I think he did alright. No one is gonna say he made the debate unfair without looking like a complete fool, and that's important. "
768,4,"> 1) He said Hillary has been fighting ISIS her entire adult life?

Yeah this shows he has 0 understanding of what ISIS is or how it was formed. "
769,1,3) He thinks opening a business that doesn't discriminate is an achievement.
770,1,"He kept slipping until he finally torpedoed himself by going after Lester then capping it with ""I have the best temperament""."
771,4,"This really made me think Trump doesn't know what he is doing. Trump has been focus grouped widely and he is constantly referred to as unstable and impulsive. This is a flaw of his that some voters dont mind because they prefer his out of the box thinking and genuine style. Those are his strengths and weaknesses.


When he says ""I have the best temperament"" he just says something that voters know isn't true. He is talking as if he doesn't know or didn't study what voters think if him."
772,1,Clinton was savage tonight. She let him dig his own hole. And boy did he keep digging
773,1,After his longest rant I swear she sighed a sigh of relief.
774,1,That hole just got 10ft deeper. 
775,1,"The fact check was his worst nightmare, it seems"
776,4,"Yeah, he was pretty weak throughout. Hell, even if you were a Trump supporter I don't see how you could think he was strong in this."
777,1,Because facts don't matter.
778,1,I trust they'll find a way on /r/The_Donald.
779,1,He was on defense nearly the ENTIRE TIME.  Absolutely brutal.
780,1,He got demolished. The birth certificate discussion was a disaster.
781,1,"He wasn't even apologetic, he was glad to tell us all about how he was the one to get Obama to release his birth certificate and that blacks and Obama should be thanking him.  When he said that he helped the black community by forcing Obama to release his birth certificate my jaw was on the floor.  "
782,1,"Considering how popular Fat People Hate was, there's at least a portion who's sticking around."
783,1,That's the voat vote. 
784,4,"So far in this election cycle, Trump has been caught redhanded doing the exact things he's been accusing Hillary of doing. Hes the king of projection. Makes me think he is having some serious health issues himself."
785,1,My favorite was when he basically told Hilary that she wasn't nice. Like... has he heard anything he's said in the past year?
786,1,"""... who had infamously cheated on his first wife.""

IIRC, he cheated on his second wife too but it was certainly big news when he cheated on his first because he married the woman he had the affair with (a young model) shortly after divorcing his wife who was a celebrity herself."
787,3,YES. Why did they not cut off the microphones during their 2 minute speeches? The media didn't want the debate; they wanted the entertainment.
788,1,The candidates would never agree to it.
789,1,"When he said this in response to bridging the racial devide I was stunned, actually stunned. Voices went all charlie browns parents for a moment as I let that moment sink in... it's one of the most out of touch responses I've seen... It almost has comedic timing with how confidently it defies comprehension."
790,1,"I didn't think he could do anything to give Clinton more of the black vote, but Stop and Frisk was struck down as Unconstitutional for a reason. He's just so out of touch...."
791,1,My understanding is that he is out of touch on all levels. He should have stayed in the shadows and continued to pay politicians to do his bidding. He would have had auch better shot at having influence and power in government. 
792,1,He's not trying to gain the black vote; it's more dog whistling to his white base.
793,1,Well what do you expect? Cyber is a very bigly problem.  /s
794,1,Security is the most important part of Cyber.
795,1,*Very smart* people

797,1,"And they said, they said to him:"
798,1,"You did a great, a really tremendous job. Believe me, folks!"
799,1,all of them
800,1,Says who?
801,1,I just said. All of them.
802,1,"ok, and your question is?"
803,1,"If it ain't Breitbart ^^^or ^^^Stormfront, it's the biased MSM!"

805,1,This other time they caught a touchdown that was actually an interception.

807,4,Trump is the guy that makes fun of the smart kid for doing his homework
808,1,He basically just told everyone else that Hillary was prepared and he had no idea what he was doing
809,1,"i mean what do you expect from the guy who said he'd first strike Iran

does this fucking idiot not realize his words have consequences?"
810,1,"""9 million people lost their jobs""

816,4,"I mean I'm not surprised that he's such a big baby

I bet he would nuke the whole Middle East if a single government official in Pakistan said something bad about him (yes, I know Pakistan isn't in the Middle East, but Trump sure as shit doesn't)"
817,3,I think that line is going to be replayed ad nauseam for the next couple of days until the next debate
818,1,"I think the profiting from he housing crisis as being ""good business"" or ""smart business"" or whatever he said is going to be the takeaway

821,4,"If cornered, his campaign (probably Conway, I don't know if Trump will actually answer) will respond by saying that it's showing that they're smart to take advantage of us.

Truly prophetic. "
826,1,Cartman is also smarter. 
827,1,Respect my authoritehh!!
828,0,*Trump's temperament 
829,1,"Oh, we of other countries don't look at this election so scornfully or mockingly, but rather in shock and disbelief. Either the majority of the US voters has lost  their rootin tootin minds or the US has ceased being a functional democracy. Both scenarios are grim :/"
830,1,"I'd recommend watching either the '08 or '12 debates, then weep at what democracy has lost."
831,2,"I like the combo of debate 1 and 2 of '12. It shows Obama getting beat pretty handedly but still staying composed. Then regrouping and  having a great showing in the second debate. 

Trump was crushed in this debate but somehow I doubt he will learn from it, work hard to prepare for the next one, and come out ready to battle."
832,4,"I think there is a very good discussion to be had over the role of the government.

But that is not what we received here tonight from Trump. Other elections are much much better."
833,0,"Romney was rich and somewhat disconnected, but he was largely a normal person with proper manners. Trump doesn't have any manners at all. No sense of what constitutes polite discourse. "
834,1,"I still liked, ""I can deal with cybersecurity because, look i have a 10 year old son, he's great with computers, you wouldn't even believe.""
 
Ok......"
835,1,"Imagine the confusion of being that kid right now. 

""What does he mean? Am I in charge of cyber intelligence now? Wtf dad?"""
836,1,This kid can make a minecraft house in ten minutes. Obviously the best at what he does
837,1,"Yes. Yes he did. As if major conflicts, world wars even, were never started as the result of one nations firing on another's warships or transports.

Edit: words n' stuff"
838,1,Oh yeah!  Absolutely fucking unreal.  
839,0,"Remember the gulf of Tonkin incident?

Trump doesn't. "
840,1,"Listen, trust me. We have to assisnate Franz Ferdinand. It totally won't start a war. Trust me."
841,1,"Come now.  When has attacking a boat ever started a war lol


(You know, other than America in WW1, Spanish American war, Pearl Harbor, War of 1812, and Vietnam). "
842,1,"Oh please.   The United States of America has only gone to war like, three, *maybe* four times tops, due to a civilian ship being destroyed by a foreign government. 

(It's something like that right? I'm a Canadian but there was that Spanish war ship, the Lusitania for WWI, was Gulf of Tonkin a civilian ship?, and I feel like I'm missing some big one somewhere)."
843,1,He was told it was unconstitutional... then KEPT ON using it as his main policy proposal. That was like Marco Rubio levels of rote memorization with no thinking on his feet.
844,1,"Not to mention him trying to deny that the murder rate in NYC continued to decline past 500/yr. It literally took me 30 seconds to look that up and prove he was lying: http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/downloads/pdf/crime_statistics/cs-en-us-city.pdf

I'm honestly trying to be open to his ideas but he just keeps spewing so much bullshit it's hard to take anything he says seriously."
845,1,"He can't help himself, he's so fucking petty - temperamentally unfit for office. "
846,1,"That's not true, he has the best temperament. A winning temperament. "
847,1,Didn't he say something like we all agree Rosie deserved it? 
848,1,They were asked to stay silent. They just didn't.
849,1,"Her ""it's a good line"" was fucking fantastic. "
850,1,Especially when you start arguing with a black man about the racist policies that were Stop and Frisk.  
851,1,"I was only listening to it on NPR, didn't know he was black. That makes it much more interesting."
852,4,"Yea, Lester Holt, the moderator, is a black man.  And he's a registered republican.  So it was especially fascinating when Trump accused him last week of being a democrat.  But then even more fascinating was that his campaign defended this error by saying that Trump didn't know that Holt was a republican, which of course begs the question as to how did Trump assume that Holt was a democrat? Because he's black? "
853,1,"This is patently false. Goldfish have perfectly average memory capabilities, and can even differentiate their owners/caretakers from other humans."
854,1,"My apologies to goldfish, lets say I was referring to the healthy cracker snack"
855,1,That was the knock-out punch.  Everything after that was him trying to get back up. 
856,1,One liner of the whole night for sure
857,4,This is the statement that will define why Hillary wins in November.
858,1,"""hey guys he gave us a shout out"""
859,1,[You're not even kidding](http://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/54ol3s/postdebate_magathread_another_win_for_trump_are/d83mt26)
860,1,Because they're not old enough to vote.
861,1,"Can you even imagine being her and hearing such horrible sexist shit about why you're unfit to be president? You don't look the part, you're mentally incompetent, etc... Glad she was able to respond to that garbagw"
862,1,she spent his time talking either smiling or looking like [this](http://67.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mb8x9iiu8q1rbzx9io2_1280.jpg)
863,1,The cocaine was wearing off towards the end and he was just getting cranky. 
864,1,"It's clearly Adderall, but yeah."
865,1,He's a creature of the 80s. I don't really think he was on coke but it wouldn't surprise me if he was because he felt he needed that old reliable boost. 
866,1,"He petered out about halfway through. It was quite amusing, you could see him get tired and frustrated."
867,3,"She definitely used her best zingers, like a greatest hits. That one, and ""the only secret is he has no plan.""  Hopefully her team comes up with new ones for the next debate. I agree with Trump that it's getting old almost as much as I agree with Hillary that it's a good one."
868,4,"Clinton basically apologising the world for Trump was actually funny, but him saying America shouldn't be a world police is also smart, but then he rambled forever"
869,1,We did! We're decided now.
870,1,I did. And now I'm not.
871,4,"Yeah, the opening handshake was good.  Then he greeted Hillary, and it was all downhill from there."
872,3,"Condescendingly asking if he could call her Secretary Clinton, and then using the word secretary in a seemingly pejorative sense throughout the debate made me angry. But Hillary's constant calm, earnest and cool attitude settled me down."
873,1,That sniffing was pretty annoying.
874,2,The crowd laughing at that was by far my favorite part of the debate.
875,4,The crowd kinda went back and forth with cheers and then Trump got laughed at and really I think that's when the election ended.
876,1,"> that's when the election ended.

or so we hope and pray"
877,1,"Exactly, hes so smart and composed, best temperament.  Yet cant stay on point, does nothing but rambles, interrupts and mocks.  Absolute shit show of a performance and I can't understand how people support someone with such little ideas on policy and what being the President actually means. 


Trump made Mitt Romney look like fucking Obama at this point."
878,1,"The funny thing is, it should've been clear months ago. 

"
879,1,[deleted]
880,2,I told a friend before the debate that there wasn't a lesser of the two evils. Now I feel like a fool. 
881,1,"Something, something, Marco Rubio. "
882,0,There was one but no follow up.  That said trump should have pivoted to that during his ramblings.  
883,0,Hillary admitted she was wrong. Trump doesn't understand how that works so he had no idea how to address it.
884,0,It seems that Trump started out restrained but got flustered and fell back into the Trump we all know. I guess what I'm saying is he doesn't have the stamina.
885,1,"The best was when she brought the lawsuits against him for not renting to black people. All he could say was, ""I never admitted guilt"" and that many other companies were being racist too."
886,0,"Yea, I thought Trump came off as... Trump"
887,1,"Ding ding, that's me. I genuinely don't remember that, I'm probably too young.

My early memories are her against Obama, and I found her lacking up against the passion that he always seemed to show.

His speeches gave me goosebumps, hers made me yawn. This was one of the first times I remember being excited about something she said."
888,1,"Fair enough, I'm excited to see it."
889,1,"When she called him out on being racist, I actually thought she had thrown him into an infinite loop of self-justifying denial."
890,1,I really liked him talking about how proud he was of opening a non-racist club in Palm Beach.
891,1,being a mom tends to prepare you for dealing with grumpy toddlers 
892,1,"Whatever she took before the event, I need a lifetime supply of."
893,1,It's her natural STAMINA
894,0,"Are we the same? I was on the well Hillary isn't trump train but after that, I can't help but smile after some of those one liners."
895,2,"You don't have to like her, but it's hard to admit this debate wasn't enjoyable in its own perverse way."
896,2,"I don't like either of them, but it was satisfying watching Donald act like it was the GOP debate and getting his ass handed to him."
897,4,"I said at the time how crazy the contrasts were.

Bernie and Hillary were deep in the weeds arguing over policy.

Trump and the repubs are calling each other names and comparing dick sizes.

It was insane. I still really don't know how we got here."
898,1,"to me she's kinda running on a ""4 year continuation of obama"" and im okay with the status quo"
899,1,"She's got a lot of sass, and I'm starting to admire it "
900,0,I hate trump so much I'm supporting hillary for the first time since 08
901,1,Thank Christ you guys are finally starting to come around.
902,1,A common symptom of space cancer
903,1,Indicates bad stamina!
904,4,"This really made me think Trump doesn't know what he is doing. Trump has been focus grouped widely and he is constantly referred to as unstable and impulsive. This is a flaw of his that some voters dont mind because they prefer his out of the box thinking and genuine style. Those are his strengths and weaknesses.


When he says ""I have the best temperament"" he just says something that voters know isn't true. He is talking as if he doesn't know or didn't study what voters think if him."
905,1,After his longest rant I swear she sighed a sigh of relief.
906,1,That hole just got 10ft deeper. 
907,1,Because facts don't matter.
908,1,I trust they'll find a way on /r/The_Donald.
909,1,"He wasn't even apologetic, he was glad to tell us all about how he was the one to get Obama to release his birth certificate and that blacks and Obama should be thanking him.  When he said that he helped the black community by forcing Obama to release his birth certificate my jaw was on the floor.  "
910,1,That's the voat vote. 
911,1,The candidates would never agree to it.
912,1,"I didn't think he could do anything to give Clinton more of the black vote, but Stop and Frisk was struck down as Unconstitutional for a reason. He's just so out of touch...."
913,1,Security is the most important part of Cyber.
914,1,And they told him! 
915,1,"And they said, they said to him:"
916,1,"You did a great, a really tremendous job. Believe me, folks!"
917,1,Says who?
