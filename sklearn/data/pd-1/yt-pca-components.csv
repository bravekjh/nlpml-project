who was raped. Every candidate has flaws. Obviously Johnson will not win, 
but that's not why I'm voting for him. I'm voting for him to send a 
message! I want actual candidates to vote for!

Hillary's ideas of a higher minimum wage and a debt free college are 
unrealistic. Higher minimum wage will only cause inflation and cause the 
value of the US dollar to go down. Minimum wage is just that! Minimum wage, 
it's for entry level positions such as fast food. You will see higher pay 
if you actually applied yourself. So sit your whining asses down! You're 
not looking or applying yourself hard enough! Quit trying to get everything 
handed to you! Debt free college is unrealistic. I don't want my tax money 
to go help a student go to college and flunk out of remedial classes 
because they messed up back in high school or where ever they were 
educated. That's unrealistic, which removes Jill Stein from the equation.

Trump's idea on abortion and gay marriage are too old fashioned for the 
America we have today. Maybe work on the adoption programs and foster care 
we have in place before worrying about being against abortion. He sounds 
like a complete idiot. He'll run America like a business and not like a 
country.

our politicians. Trump is most likely right. The differences is that 
opponents did not like hearing those words from his mouth. And HIllary 
mentioned that Bias is a systemic and national problem in our country which 
is true also. I did not watch this debate live. Although most political 
experts deemed Hillary the winner from this debate, this 1st debate seemed 
to be much more civil than the 2nd and 3rd debates. Both candidates spoke 
well on some topics in regards to police training & racial bias. They 
weren't actually going at each other's throats on those topics. Trump had 
major points about government instability. He did nail it in regards to the 
costs and charging of spending. When I was in the Army, I had to perform 
something called PMCS checks on a Humvee assigned to me. And it nearly took 
a year and a half to receive the chains ordered for the hummer assigned to 
me. I and my fellow soldiers would scratch our heads on why something so 
mundane as chains for tires took so long to order? There could have been 
other factors too such as leadership above us dragging their feet within 
our ""chain of command"" submitting the order. Trust me when I say this, I'm 
proud to be a veteran in the US Army, but at least the Army that I was 
assigned to often did not get the job done in an expedient manner. I'm just 
telling it like it is. I'm sure other branches of service may have similar 
experiences about the virtual bureaucratic red tape that exists within all 
forms of the military and federal government. Our leadership could have 
thrown money together in a pot and bought chains at a local auto parts 
store for some tires needed to complete our inventories. But that was of 
course considered illegal because the chains that the government 
must approve of all certified parts and must go through proper channels. 
Which is agreeable. But again, there is no excuse that such a mundane part 
should have taken so long to order. Just my two cents on some of us in the 
military feeling the brunt of government inefficiency at that time. I'm

228,"Everyone's so worried about Donald Trump causing another world war with 
some other country, but seeing that him and Putin are on friendly terms, 
there's a very unlikely chance that a nuclear war or a similar war decades 
ago will reoccur. That's how I see it right now. And if in fact a war does 
break out, then it won't be a problem for America, taking in consideration 
about how advanced our military technology is and our allies, which are 
superpowers in this world. Trump is a bully and bigot. His behavior is at 
times unacceptable, and I dislike how he expresses his ideas. However, I 
believe, as a Republican and a Christian, that his campaign is not 
outrageous nor is it worse than Clinton's. He is also very clean when it 
comes to politics because he has no previous affiliations with politicians. 
However, being a main factor is why people voted for Clinton, her extensive 
background in politics makes her more vulnerable to having to put interest 
to her 'fellow' politicians if she won the election. Her lies would become 
bigger and bigger, just like her email issues. Her view on social issues 
clash greatly with mine, and I think that was a major factor in the 
reasoning of why I support Trump. These days, social issues are a huge deal 
to many people and the sensitivity to it has increased dramatically. 
Although Trump is a man who was never affiliated with politics/military and 
is solely a business man, you could obviously tell by the results of this 
election that he prudently calculated the probability of him winning, which 
was a main reason in his decision to run. Also, many people claim Trump is 
'gay'. Seeing that a) they insult him based on his sexuality or made-up 
sexuality b) they look down on him because of how is reported to be 'gay', 
they aren't fit to be a supporter of both the Democrat or Republican side. 
These hypocrites (Clinton supporters) who slam him down because they think 
he is homosexual is going against what the Democrats sought for: accepting 
everyone, whether or not they're gay or lesbian, transgender, a minority or 
Caucasian, etc.. These sorts of nonsense commentary about him and his 
personal life doesn't affect anyone, but just degrades the anonymous users 
behind these computer screens because of their seemingly uneducated 
background by using that type of diction. I think I covered most of the 
reasons why I support Trump and his campaign to #makeamericagreatagain. I 
hope those who read this will respect my opinion, and will take it into 
consideration before talking smack about Trump again. Thank you and let's 
see what America has in store for everyone. Good night.",0.18507155824,-0.0556604240572

Is that is very vague in his answers leaving it open to perception and 
people can set them selves up to a false outcome

One thing im noticing his on about slashing taxes, but then his on about 
policing the streets with stop and search

Taxes help pay for public services (Well thats how it works in the UK, and 
I would imagine its the same if not similar in the US) so how do you reduce 
the government income to then say hey, we now going to milk the pot by 
putting police on the streets doing stop and searches) which risks 
segregation.

You have this strerotype that black men from ""Hoods"" or poor neighborhoods 
are heavily involved in armed crime (such as the cribs vs bloods) now I am 
not saying every black male does this so please dont twist my words, but I 
am saying if this stereotype exists you will get a lot of people being 
unnecessarily frisked, this will cause people to feel oppressed by the 
police and where this is still fresh in the black community specially since 
they havent let the whole Rodney King incident lie and that was over 25 yrs 
ago, 

Whilst previously I was a trump supporter just out of ludicracy and seing a 
change
If i was to be serious for a moment, I feel trump will be negative for the 
US

Not saying Hilliary is perfect look at the Email scandal, but she has the 
mannerism is more professional and more suited to the role that Trump, its 
just a shame its boiled down to therse two canditates for the US,

Some may argue whats it to do with the UK.
The USA is a powerhouse, its one of the largest bodies and influencial 
countries in the world and a lot of political decisions that take place in 
the US eventually affect other countries

I dont think it will be as dramatic as some people make out when 
interviewing the general public on the news, there will always be advisors 
the president has and the last thing you want is to anger the people you 
serve as they can turn on you, history shows this

Presidents have been known to have been assasenated, so i dont think for a 
moment it will cause the end of the world, but i dont think some of their 
decisions wont be detrimental to people ie Wars in syria or russia with no 
fly zones, or breaking the american bank and make america fall into further 
debt, poverty, crime will increase etc and wars can break out between other 
countries such as Mexico and its alies

Not sure if it would play out like that but I guess we will find out after

about politics the only reason I am voting is
to keep hillary clinton out of the white house. due to her mishandling of 
classified information, her taking massive amounts of
money from corporate backers, due to her sociopathic use of accusations of 
sexual misconduct against her opponent while having silenced multiple 
victims of sexual assault in the past when it suited her, her pulling money 
out of her foundation that
was intended to help people she insist's are going to be oppressed by her 
opponents, as well a large number of people who were supposed to testify 
against her have turned up dead and the fact she will likely start ww3 with 
russia I would have to say for me this election is about the morality of 
the candidates and don't misunderstand I don't think donald trump is an 
angel 
but even though I am a libertarian I would sacrifice every political view I 
have to keep that warmongering sociopath out of the white house I WOULD 
HAVE VOTED FOR BERNIE SANDERS OVER HER AND HE AND I DONT AGREE ON ANYTHING.
I feel sorry for american democrats that this wretched woman managed to 
sabotage bernies bid for the democratic nomination
as while I don't agree with his politics I wouldn't have bothered to vote 
against him since I think he is just a human with 
different political views then me and not actually a bad person (at least 
by politician standards) this woman stole your dnc nomination, she has 
silenced victims of sexual assault when it suited her, she breaks the laws 
of this country whenever she wants, is in the pocket of numerous corporate 
backers, is suspected though not proven guilty by myself and others of 
having people who testify against her killed, has been disgustingly 
contempt filled towards her own supporters in her emails,and people who 
work for her HAVE BEEN CAUGHT ON VIDEO admitting to voter fraud, and 
inciting violence at trump rallies.
AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF she is attempting actions that could spark a third 
world war. american liberals I implore you please
do not vote for this women she doesn't care about you,she has galvanized 
your opposition in this race,she has stolen your nomination from you, shown 
contempt for you,and lied to you. I understand fully your dislike of donald 
trump on both a personal level as he is brash and vulgar and on a political 
level I will never fault you for disagreeing with me or mister trump 
about political issues but the worst the man will do deregulate american 
business and make it difficult to immigrate to this country hillary will 
start a world war please don't let this sociopath play you. sanders or 
someone else can be elected on the
next go around but we have to have not been nuked in the next four years

filter out laws, politicians etc. we sit blind to in there birthing phase

789,"Peaple you are correct about them. I know something that would shock the 
world. The Antichrist gave them a extra power to there own power that would 
floor you. I have Proof and i cannot explain how but i can say allot about 
it. The Power gave to the Queen by the Antichrist is Youth and other things 
with it. The Antichrist has shocking power inside him to keep peaple alive 
wile torchoring peaple for years and to give Youth to anyone. The 
Antichrist can remove Deadly illeness out of anyone and give it to anyone. 
Antichrist is very evil and i think you all know why? Who is the devil? 
Hint? What power in the Devil is possable in the years of the Antichrist. 
They can do anything and i am not kidding around they can walk through 
walls stand around were you cannot see them. Home privacy is invaded in 
mean manners you are being watched in the bathroom at home in your bedroom 
at home. Your being laughed at! The Royals are not so nice and not anymore. 
There is allot more to this power. The Queen goes out in public looking 
normal and in secret privacy not even peaple that work for her knows. There 
could be a few workers that have agreed the secret or elce. She looks young 
with her Husband. She is way different looking than her young adult years. 
We are talking bigger Breast and a body women dream about. The other Royals 
have taken some of these powers to secretly look better to advance there 
looks. They were given energy to stay awake at all hours of the night also. 
The Antichrist can here peaple in the worlds thinking. There know what you 
think at all times the Queen also took that on With her Husband. They think 
evil thoughts about the peaple in the world along with this Antichrist. The 
Antichrist has been here for years and be honest with yourselfs and ask 
yourself when was this mark given to you years ago. Do anyone of you 
remember a strange males voice in your homes asking you if you were a 
christian?! That was the Antichrist. He would keep asking until you gave a 
awnser and it made you scared maby, confused maby. When you said no that 
you were not a Christian, Guess what? You got marked by Satan from the 
Antichrist. It happend! They did this to the world quick and sneaky for 
most peaple in the world. The high power leaders communicate with him. The 
world is now a sick evil joke and some of the High power leaders is in 
pretend mode with humans with some stuff they do. There lives are easy in 
ways and they live off powers to have more fun it's like better than a 
fairytail for them. our leaders are pulling your chain now! They will 
always make things look normal in front of your faces and your hearing. 
They gave Vanity and great bodies to certain peaple and we are talking 
major Vanity here. Satan is evil in Vanity issues and it happend through 
the Antichrist! There was a deal made with these select high power peaple 
from the Antichrist and he gave them this Vanity and energy and knowledge 
more than anyone could understand. They are up wile the world sleeps! They 
trully don't care about you. It is not just the peaple torchoring that they 
hate it is everyone in the world. They care for there family but there not 
so concerned about you. The Antichrist Hates all Human peaple in this

1005,"My point of view about this debate:
1) I think there should be some other candidate for President. It sounded 
both were just roasting each other. 
Instead of talking about the country they are just talking about each other.
2) Plans of trump like cutting Tax is very good. Because in long run this 
will work if we study this 
system properly, it answers itself. Because cutting tax will get jobs back 
and addition to few more plans that will
bring more jobs, makes it perfect. Even though Hillary thinks other way 
round pointing towards middle class but 
the number of jobs it will make is less than the jobs that will be lost. 
Also cutting tax to wealthy class or 
business people should come with constraints of employment to automatically 
concentrate on the whole countries 
financial issue and employment. Also investments and concentration on 
Research and development, innovation and small 
business will lead to increase in employment.
3) Race Question: It can be done by giving equal opportunities to all races 
and legally taking action against 
those who discriminate. And create a community, having all races as 
employees in every sector, who will manage all the 
complaints related to race, which will be answered directly by the 
President and will run independently. And this community 
should be easily accessible. Educational system should also be targeted to 
teach kids to help remove race discrimination. 
Because the knowledge and habits at the early age is more effective. 
Problem of races is problem of all countries so the 
above things I mentioned is good at Presidential level but this is actual 
work of everyone of us.
