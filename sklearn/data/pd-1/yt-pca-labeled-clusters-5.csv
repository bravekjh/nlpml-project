should go back to the west, But he doesn't like saying that americans are 
immigrants."
6,0,"I really don't care what happens because the president doesn't have all the 
power. The U.S.A's main governmental power is divided into three branches, 
as we all know: The Executive Branch, The Legislative Branch, and The 
Judicial Branch. If the president wants to sent out new laws, 2/3 of the 
Legislative Branch must agree on it, or else it would be overwrited."

23,4,"I love Donald Trump. I hate Hilary Cliton! Because she is such a liar and 
she didn't deserve to be president. Donald Trump won the election last 
week, and I'm happy because he and Mike Pence Vice President are going to 
make America great again!"

journal, Homicide, Rape and Robbery increased and has been since the new

TEASED THE CANDIDATES. YES THATS ALL FUN AND GAMES. BUT NOW WHEN IT GETS 
SERIOUS. WHEN YOU HAVE TO FREAKING GROW UP. SURE IM NOT OLD ENOUGH TO VOTE 
YET. BUT WHEN YOU DO TAKE MY WORDS. THE MEMES, THE LIES, THE JOKES. WHEN 
YOU VOTE. DONT YOU DARE THINK OF ONE OF THOSE. EVER. LOOK AT THEIR 
BACKGROUND. LOOK AT WHAT THEY DO FOR A LIVING. LOOK AT WHAT THEY ARE SAYING 
WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. OK SURE DONALD TRUMP INNTERUPTS HILLARY A WHOLE LOT. 
BUT THATS WHAT THEY DO IN DEBATES. THEY FIGHT AND ARGUE. JUST LIKE 
SIBLINGS. SO WHEN YOU VOTE. THINK OF THE REAL THINGS. THATS HOW YOU TRULY 
FIND THE BEST CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT. SURE IF THEY LIE ON WHAT THEY SAY 
YOU KNOW WHAT AMERICA NEEDS THEN. EVERYBODY IS HATING ON OBAMA. BUT YOU

POLITICS. I LEARNED HOW TO EVALUATE A CANDIDATE. YOU CAN NOW PICK AND 
CHOOSE. AND LIKE I SAID IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS TELL ME BECAUSE I

58,0,"Do you really want that person to be the next president, maybe he has good 
points, but is a terrible human being, he is the most horrific person after 
Hitler"
59,0,"I'm really scared. I don't like any of them but it's been my life long 
dream to live in America. I'm turkish and of course a muslim, if Donald 
Trump wins i won't be able to move to USA. I'm feeling so stressed and I've 
already planned my future in USA with my cousin/best friend, it all will 
crash down if he wins. I'm not saying Hillary is better or smarter but 
seriously he has a lot of dumb ideas, he wants to remove muslims from the 
country and build a wall. Many families will be separated! I understand 
that he mostly thinks about ISIS but that doesn't mean all of the muslims 
are dangerous. 95% muslims are really peaceful. I wouldn't even hurt a fly."
60,0,do not vote for Donltromp or Hilerycliton!‼‼!😧
61,1,trump goes off topic alot if you havent notice
62,3,"This is why I'm for Johnson! Let him debate! Before you come at me with 
Aleppo, remember the missing e-mails on Hillary's side and Trump's 'locker 
room' talk. Before you say how he blanked and couldn't name a foreign 
leader, remember Trump's missing tax returns and Hillary defending a child 
who was raped. Every candidate has flaws. Obviously Johnson will not win, 
but that's not why I'm voting for him. I'm voting for him to send a 
message! I want actual candidates to vote for!

Hillary's ideas of a higher minimum wage and a debt free college are 
unrealistic. Higher minimum wage will only cause inflation and cause the 
value of the US dollar to go down. Minimum wage is just that! Minimum wage, 
it's for entry level positions such as fast food. You will see higher pay 
if you actually applied yourself. So sit your whining asses down! You're 
not looking or applying yourself hard enough! Quit trying to get everything 
handed to you! Debt free college is unrealistic. I don't want my tax money 
to go help a student go to college and flunk out of remedial classes 
because they messed up back in high school or where ever they were 
educated. That's unrealistic, which removes Jill Stein from the equation.

Trump's idea on abortion and gay marriage are too old fashioned for the 
America we have today. Maybe work on the adoption programs and foster care 
we have in place before worrying about being against abortion. He sounds 
like a complete idiot. He'll run America like a business and not like a 
country. 

That's my opinion (as a current college student working a part-time job 
which technically is on minimum wage but + tips)."
63,4,"I just need to ask the Trump supporters, is Trump a racist? I want to 
suport him over the witch but not if hes a racist."
64,0,"Hilary and Trump are both racists and hate gay people and immigrants so why 
make Hilary look better."
65,0,IM COUNTING DOWN THE HOURs UNTIL AMERICA PERISHES.
66,0,"Donald Trump sounds like he's literally just playing the blame game and his 
plans sound like they rely a lot on 'if we can do this' or on other people 
- when that doesn't work what's his plans then?
A third world country? This man is truly despicable, how about you go and 
live in a third world country then come back and tell me your sob story 
about airports in the US.
As soon as he starts talking about Nuclear and not taking it off the table 
that should have shut his campaign down instantly."
67,3,"As a Brit can someone explain to me how Hillary Clinton won the most votes 
in election but Donald Trump is President Elect?"
68,0,"My god she is a smug pos. Anyone voting for this liar/murderer is as 
corrupt and evil as she is"
69,4,That sexual predator trump is disgusting. No woman shold vote for him.
70,0,"This lying bitch got what she deserved. She can now go with her satanic 
friends and eat the blood, sperm and breast milk food they love to gorge 
on. Disgusting freaks."
71,4,"Trump is misleading citizens and humanity, and he is a bad influence for 
anybody in a very tragic way. All he promotes is hate, racism, and bigotry. 
And he is lying to everybody."
72,4,"Only idiots, racist, and bigots support that sexual predator trump. Some 
people just love bullshit."
73,0,"I love how Trump in all of the debates, he always wore the American flag. 
True American. He will make America great again. :)"
74,4,"Trump is the worst person for president any nation could even have. This 
has to be some kind of joke or a nightmare."
75,0,"""The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African American 
men""!? What an oversimplified view of a much deeper social problem. Typical 
leftist taking every opportunity to disarm the public."
76,0,"A sexual predator and the foreinger gold diger in the white house are like 
an abomination. What the hell is going on?"
77,0,"You know guys it is getting down to the wire.  In two days you have to vote 
for president.  Try to put your total feelings aside, I know that neither 
one are great, but what you have to do is look at the one who is most 
worthy..  Clinton who has stole from the country, is on the hit list of the 
FBI,  who is a liar... A women who wants to keep Health Care Reform going 
which is falling in the tanks but the even more disturbing problem is that 
she wants to make it a Single Payer System, Government controlled if you 
don't know what that means.   Meaning that the Government is going to say 
what you can and cannot do in regard to your Healthcare.  That is sad..  Is 
that what you want or the Man who yes may be a little troubled when it 
comes to talking about Women ( which I do not believe all of the omen that 
have SUDDENLEY come about their story) a man who yes took advantage of the 
loop holes in taxes but wants to do something about it,  Who does have good 
ideas on keeping the illegals out while keeping those who work legally in. 
It's on your shoulders now.  Try to make the best decision you can clearly 
thinking who has the best in mind for us.  Do not vote for a Women because 
she is a Women that is ridiculous and if you do you should feel ashamed."

racist and a sexual predator."
92,0,"How to know when Clinton is lying? She opens her mouth. Also, she had a 
'tell', as a professional card player would say. Every time she sort of 
'scratched' her face it was to say to Lester Holt, 'throw it to me', and he 
did. Such corruption."
93,4,"HEY TRUMP SUPPORTERS! Yes, you! I want you to give me some reasons to vote

allow his Taxes release or investigation By The I.R.S that's some B.S. 
Howard Stern had Donald trump on the he show he say in confession that he 
goes in the women dress room uninvited cause he own it. WTF is wrong with 
Donald trump supporters there been my individual analysis Trump and Hillary 
Clinton taxes reforms. These independent analysis say donald trump would 
put 4 trillions on the nation debt and hillary clinton would be a slow 1 
percent growth in economy."

Trump won!"
137,0,"the truth is that donald is a business man (child) who has an ideal to 
improve mostly the economy, whether it will work or not no one knows 
because he doesnt have any government experience. His tendencies and 
judgement are irratic and if any thing was to go from bad to worse itd be 
with donald because he IS a ruthless business person, Not a politician. You 
can even tell that he can't even answer half the questions properly; only 
deflecting with hatred and other negative comments about hilarys past.
Hilary is a traitor blah blah but at least she has apologized. She also 
knows how to stop and listen which is important if neither of them have 
been a president before... Also if bill clinton comes along with hilary how 
do we know he wont have any input in making americas economy good again 
also.
What you all dont see is that pass all the fact checking through these 
debates, donald should only be an economic advisor at best.... to say 
worthy of being a president is beyond ridiculous. 
Americans should worry about the people who are voting for trump because i 
would love to hear a rational argument for once."

212,0,"Trump mentioned that the African American community has been let down by 
our politicians. Trump is most likely right. The differences is that 
opponents did not like hearing those words from his mouth. And HIllary 
mentioned that Bias is a systemic and national problem in our country which 
is true also. I did not watch this debate live. Although most political 
experts deemed Hillary the winner from this debate, this 1st debate seemed 
to be much more civil than the 2nd and 3rd debates. Both candidates spoke 
well on some topics in regards to police training & racial bias. They 
weren't actually going at each other's throats on those topics. Trump had 
major points about government instability. He did nail it in regards to the 
costs and charging of spending. When I was in the Army, I had to perform 
something called PMCS checks on a Humvee assigned to me. And it nearly took 
a year and a half to receive the chains ordered for the hummer assigned to 
me. I and my fellow soldiers would scratch our heads on why something so 
mundane as chains for tires took so long to order? There could have been 
other factors too such as leadership above us dragging their feet within 
our ""chain of command"" submitting the order. Trust me when I say this, I'm 
proud to be a veteran in the US Army, but at least the Army that I was 
assigned to often did not get the job done in an expedient manner. I'm just 
telling it like it is. I'm sure other branches of service may have similar 
experiences about the virtual bureaucratic red tape that exists within all 
forms of the military and federal government. Our leadership could have 
thrown money together in a pot and bought chains at a local auto parts 
store for some tires needed to complete our inventories. But that was of 
course considered illegal because the chains that the government 
must approve of all certified parts and must go through proper channels. 
Which is agreeable. But again, there is no excuse that such a mundane part 
should have taken so long to order. Just my two cents on some of us in the 
military feeling the brunt of government inefficiency at that time. I'm 
sure there are still problems within all forms of federal spending."

Additionally, Donald is decreasing the tax percentages, for business so 
they can stay here, in America. As we know, that a lot of our GOOD business 
are moving to Mexico...What happen to the good all days, when your grandma 
was getting paid good money for working hard; Example, good benefits, paid 
vacation, and business trips...

227,0,"The only factor is not the work who speak with him by the Minister and 
Secretary"
228,4,"Everyone's so worried about Donald Trump causing another world war with 
some other country, but seeing that him and Putin are on friendly terms, 
there's a very unlikely chance that a nuclear war or a similar war decades 
ago will reoccur. That's how I see it right now. And if in fact a war does 
break out, then it won't be a problem for America, taking in consideration 
about how advanced our military technology is and our allies, which are 
superpowers in this world. Trump is a bully and bigot. His behavior is at 
times unacceptable, and I dislike how he expresses his ideas. However, I 
believe, as a Republican and a Christian, that his campaign is not 
outrageous nor is it worse than Clinton's. He is also very clean when it 
comes to politics because he has no previous affiliations with politicians. 
However, being a main factor is why people voted for Clinton, her extensive 
background in politics makes her more vulnerable to having to put interest 
to her 'fellow' politicians if she won the election. Her lies would become 
bigger and bigger, just like her email issues. Her view on social issues 
clash greatly with mine, and I think that was a major factor in the 
reasoning of why I support Trump. These days, social issues are a huge deal 
to many people and the sensitivity to it has increased dramatically. 
Although Trump is a man who was never affiliated with politics/military and 
is solely a business man, you could obviously tell by the results of this 
election that he prudently calculated the probability of him winning, which 
was a main reason in his decision to run. Also, many people claim Trump is 
'gay'. Seeing that a) they insult him based on his sexuality or made-up 
sexuality b) they look down on him because of how is reported to be 'gay', 
they aren't fit to be a supporter of both the Democrat or Republican side. 
These hypocrites (Clinton supporters) who slam him down because they think 
he is homosexual is going against what the Democrats sought for: accepting 
everyone, whether or not they're gay or lesbian, transgender, a minority or 
Caucasian, etc.. These sorts of nonsense commentary about him and his 
personal life doesn't affect anyone, but just degrades the anonymous users 
behind these computer screens because of their seemingly uneducated 
background by using that type of diction. I think I covered most of the 
reasons why I support Trump and his campaign to #makeamericagreatagain. I 
hope those who read this will respect my opinion, and will take it into 
consideration before talking smack about Trump again. Thank you and let's 
see what America has in store for everyone. Good night."

334,0,"Hi im British 
I have been listening to this whilst working and some problems im picking 
up with Trump
Is that is very vague in his answers leaving it open to perception and 
people can set them selves up to a false outcome

One thing im noticing his on about slashing taxes, but then his on about 
policing the streets with stop and search

Taxes help pay for public services (Well thats how it works in the UK, and 
I would imagine its the same if not similar in the US) so how do you reduce 
the government income to then say hey, we now going to milk the pot by 
putting police on the streets doing stop and searches) which risks 
segregation.

You have this strerotype that black men from ""Hoods"" or poor neighborhoods 
are heavily involved in armed crime (such as the cribs vs bloods) now I am 
not saying every black male does this so please dont twist my words, but I 
am saying if this stereotype exists you will get a lot of people being 
unnecessarily frisked, this will cause people to feel oppressed by the 
police and where this is still fresh in the black community specially since 
they havent let the whole Rodney King incident lie and that was over 25 yrs 
ago, 

Whilst previously I was a trump supporter just out of ludicracy and seing a 
change
If i was to be serious for a moment, I feel trump will be negative for the 
US

Not saying Hilliary is perfect look at the Email scandal, but she has the 
mannerism is more professional and more suited to the role that Trump, its 
just a shame its boiled down to therse two canditates for the US,

Some may argue whats it to do with the UK.
The USA is a powerhouse, its one of the largest bodies and influencial 
countries in the world and a lot of political decisions that take place in 
the US eventually affect other countries

I dont think it will be as dramatic as some people make out when 
interviewing the general public on the news, there will always be advisors 
the president has and the last thing you want is to anger the people you 
serve as they can turn on you, history shows this

Presidents have been known to have been assasenated, so i dont think for a 
moment it will cause the end of the world, but i dont think some of their 
decisions wont be detrimental to people ie Wars in syria or russia with no 
fly zones, or breaking the american bank and make america fall into further 
debt, poverty, crime will increase etc and wars can break out between other 
countries such as Mexico and its alies

Not sure if it would play out like that but I guess we will find out after 
tonight"

everything and that has been proven time and time again that it is a LIE.
Anyone that votes for Hillary is agreeing to continue conforming to 
Government Brain Washing and Lies. If you are happy with the way the 
Government is Today, and Do Not Want or Care if it Changes for the Better, 
Then Go Ahead and Vote For More Consistent Failure, and Believe the Lies 
That You Will Be Told to Cover up Her Failures if you put her in the White 
House. 
She Knows if Trump is Elected That All the Truth Will Finally Come Out, as 
it Should,

people would find out where they stood, oh not in ""Trump Land"" he does not 
give a chite about you, once he has your vote you will be like a bit of 
bubble gum tossed into the gutter. Do you really think he cares about you, 
No No, he just wants adoration. Go on Bow to Trump, you will all regret it. 
But I am but a single voice, so why should you care, but please please do 
he is not built to be a Leader of a Great Country, he is good in business, 
that is obvious, but that does NOT make him a good leader of such a great 
Country as I have said before before. It would be very immature of us to 
really really put our trust in any Politicians, I would not trust one as

naive to think that a president has that kind of power today,

 We've been riding a bloated, wasteful infrastructure for decades beyond
what it can handle - because it is profitable for people such as these
two ! 
Our society is rife with corruption, so much that we do not have the 
stomach or resolve to make the simplest of changes. We've already got 
plenty of fine ideas and solutions - but we can't act on them 
effectively. For one, our sovereignty was severely damaged with the 
creation of the 
Fed and The Great Depression (95+% of our gold was mandated by law to 
sell to foreign gold market-flippers in the 1930s - and afaik fort knox 
has not been audited since, amongst a multitude of other tragedies) . 
T-Rump is an egotist and a bullshitter extraordinaire that's winging it
on 9 of every 10 talking points... while Shillary's transgressions are

nationally"". The republican party has it's agenda based on, ""[w]e gotta 
save the country from those (""Stronger Together"") voters""; because they are 
causing a massive degree of harm to themselves...
Think about it folks and get out and vote for Hillary...then turn to your

Is this not prepared by both sides as well as anticipated? Are they not 
trying to make points that were written for them based on what they believe 
in? Hearing each other's comments they are both taken aback and wonder what 
they're saying themselves is right or wrong. Because it's been prepared. 
Because they hear an argument that is decent against their prepared 
monologue. Each of these candidates fear each other and are afraid of what 
each other will actually do if elected.

about politics the only reason I am voting is
to keep hillary clinton out of the white house. due to her mishandling of 
classified information, her taking massive amounts of
money from corporate backers, due to her sociopathic use of accusations of 
sexual misconduct against her opponent while having silenced multiple 
victims of sexual assault in the past when it suited her, her pulling money 
out of her foundation that
was intended to help people she insist's are going to be oppressed by her 
opponents, as well a large number of people who were supposed to testify 
against her have turned up dead and the fact she will likely start ww3 with 
russia I would have to say for me this election is about the morality of 
the candidates and don't misunderstand I don't think donald trump is an 
angel 
but even though I am a libertarian I would sacrifice every political view I 
have to keep that warmongering sociopath out of the white house I WOULD 
HAVE VOTED FOR BERNIE SANDERS OVER HER AND HE AND I DONT AGREE ON ANYTHING.
I feel sorry for american democrats that this wretched woman managed to 
sabotage bernies bid for the democratic nomination
as while I don't agree with his politics I wouldn't have bothered to vote 
against him since I think he is just a human with 
different political views then me and not actually a bad person (at least 
by politician standards) this woman stole your dnc nomination, she has 
silenced victims of sexual assault when it suited her, she breaks the laws 
of this country whenever she wants, is in the pocket of numerous corporate 
backers, is suspected though not proven guilty by myself and others of 
having people who testify against her killed, has been disgustingly 
contempt filled towards her own supporters in her emails,and people who 
work for her HAVE BEEN CAUGHT ON VIDEO admitting to voter fraud, and 
inciting violence at trump rallies.
AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF she is attempting actions that could spark a third 
world war. american liberals I implore you please
do not vote for this women she doesn't care about you,she has galvanized 
your opposition in this race,she has stolen your nomination from you, shown 
contempt for you,and lied to you. I understand fully your dislike of donald 
trump on both a personal level as he is brash and vulgar and on a political 
level I will never fault you for disagreeing with me or mister trump 
about political issues but the worst the man will do deregulate american 
business and make it difficult to immigrate to this country hillary will 
start a world war please don't let this sociopath play you. sanders or 
someone else can be elected on the
next go around but we have to have not been nuked in the next four years 
for that to happen PLEASE don't vote for her.
that said I hold no contempt for you even if you ignore me here. if you

the American people st this election. When the freedoms that Americans have 
enjoyed and now take for granted these fiascos happen. St a recent election 
in my small suburb of approximately 20,000. 900 people turned out to vote 
on local matters. city council, milages etc. Then all 20,000 complained at 
the results. We are very young country. less than 250 years old. And this 
sickness cthat has set in in America is sickness that is best to have when 
your still young. We have to learn that can no longer rely on our system to 
filter out laws, politicians etc. we sit blind to in there birthing phase 
then wonder how all this happened. A democracy is no better than the values 
of the people. America will survive this mess and hopefully learn from it. 
How many of us go or have ever gone to a city council meeting? We vote for 
drain commissioner. How many know what a drain commissioner is let alone 
qualifications? If we choose to ignore or system of govt. then it's 
participants will always have the final say. It is what it is. Nothing we 
can do about the past. But, with this election as a reminder, maybe we can 
help our future."

for the same crimes if any crimes at all. They're also so cowardly both 
Trump and Clinton not saying what the true issue is. Most of the guns here 
increasing gun crime are illegal gun owners. It has nothing to do with 
buying and background checks, because a 14 yr old gang banger isn't getting 
background checks because they're not buying guns. That means the

737,0,"According to Forbes, ""under Trumps new plan, every income group would still 
get tax cuts but upper income households would receive most of the relief, 
not only in dollars, but as a percentage of income. The poorest 20% of 
households would get tax cut averaging just $110, raising their after tax 
income by 0.8%. Middle income households would save an average of $1,010, 
boosting their after tax income by 1.5%. some moderate income single 
parents would actually end up paying HIGHER individual income taxes, since 
Trump would eliminate the ""head of household"" filing status, meaning they 
would be treated the same as singles when it comes to both the standard 
deduction and the tax bracket. in addition some large families would also 
pay more, since the personal exemption would be eliminated by Trump's 
plan."""

you pick. But instead of picking another Clinton which lied to you already

rich and bigger companies more surely that will only make them leave and 
thus taking their jobs with them. Surely Trumps idea of taxing imports more 
and cutting business tax would be a better treat for share holders and 
owners of the big corps. Yeh Trump is a loud mouth outspoken sexiest pig

by far not the most important thing America needs. He's missing the most 
important part; a leader needs to connect to his highest character, being

789,0,"Peaple you are correct about them. I know something that would shock the 
world. The Antichrist gave them a extra power to there own power that would 
floor you. I have Proof and i cannot explain how but i can say allot about 
it. The Power gave to the Queen by the Antichrist is Youth and other things 
with it. The Antichrist has shocking power inside him to keep peaple alive 
wile torchoring peaple for years and to give Youth to anyone. The 
Antichrist can remove Deadly illeness out of anyone and give it to anyone. 
Antichrist is very evil and i think you all know why? Who is the devil? 
Hint? What power in the Devil is possable in the years of the Antichrist. 
They can do anything and i am not kidding around they can walk through 
walls stand around were you cannot see them. Home privacy is invaded in 
mean manners you are being watched in the bathroom at home in your bedroom 
at home. Your being laughed at! The Royals are not so nice and not anymore. 
There is allot more to this power. The Queen goes out in public looking 
normal and in secret privacy not even peaple that work for her knows. There 
could be a few workers that have agreed the secret or elce. She looks young 
with her Husband. She is way different looking than her young adult years. 
We are talking bigger Breast and a body women dream about. The other Royals 
have taken some of these powers to secretly look better to advance there 
looks. They were given energy to stay awake at all hours of the night also. 
The Antichrist can here peaple in the worlds thinking. There know what you 
think at all times the Queen also took that on With her Husband. They think 
evil thoughts about the peaple in the world along with this Antichrist. The 
Antichrist has been here for years and be honest with yourselfs and ask 
yourself when was this mark given to you years ago. Do anyone of you 
remember a strange males voice in your homes asking you if you were a 
christian?! That was the Antichrist. He would keep asking until you gave a 
awnser and it made you scared maby, confused maby. When you said no that 
you were not a Christian, Guess what? You got marked by Satan from the 
Antichrist. It happend! They did this to the world quick and sneaky for 
most peaple in the world. The high power leaders communicate with him. The 
world is now a sick evil joke and some of the High power leaders is in 
pretend mode with humans with some stuff they do. There lives are easy in 
ways and they live off powers to have more fun it's like better than a 
fairytail for them. our leaders are pulling your chain now! They will 
always make things look normal in front of your faces and your hearing. 
They gave Vanity and great bodies to certain peaple and we are talking 
major Vanity here. Satan is evil in Vanity issues and it happend through 
the Antichrist! There was a deal made with these select high power peaple 
from the Antichrist and he gave them this Vanity and energy and knowledge 
more than anyone could understand. They are up wile the world sleeps! They 
trully don't care about you. It is not just the peaple torchoring that they 
hate it is everyone in the world. They care for there family but there not 
so concerned about you. The Antichrist Hates all Human peaple in this 
world! It's like he became Satan himself when Satan gave him Power to give 
the Mark in the first place."

about what has been going on for years but he actually isn't in bed with 
nearly as many people as Clinton is. Yes words are said and the media

how poor his temperament really is- especially when shown in stark contrast

from Austria( NO NOT AUSTRALIA, AUSTRIA) and there is no question about 
""who to vote for"". It´s simple: Everything about trump got leaked(playboy 
etc) but was that really that bad? I mean, what´s so bad about someone who 
has some stuff going on, that shouldn´t even interest anybody outside his 
family. Ever heard about privacy? But Hillary is just evil. And to all the 
people that say"" I hate trump he said some pervert stuff""´: SHUT THE 
FU**UP. You don´t even wanna know how the austrian people are laughing 
about the hillary voters. Even in school we learn how hillary is going to 
destroy the world if she wins. It´s simple: Hillary just wants the power, 
she doesn´t care for the normal people LIKE YOU, she will just help the 
rich ones-trust me. If i see trump I see someone who did some mistakes, if 
i see hillary i see someone who will do mistakes. And even if I ignore 
everything I already siad: I can´t look at Hillary without seeing someone 
who WILL start a war. 
My mother always says to me that there is no election-because hillary got 
the right people on her side and that your vote doesn´t count because she 
already won.

IF THAT HAPPENS: ARM YOURSELF AND PROTECT YOURSELF AGAINST HER. If voters 
can´t stop her, bullets can.

1004,0,Bernie for pres
1005,0,"My point of view about this debate:
1) I think there should be some other candidate for President. It sounded 
both were just roasting each other. 
Instead of talking about the country they are just talking about each other.
2) Plans of trump like cutting Tax is very good. Because in long run this 
will work if we study this 
system properly, it answers itself. Because cutting tax will get jobs back 
and addition to few more plans that will
bring more jobs, makes it perfect. Even though Hillary thinks other way 
round pointing towards middle class but 
the number of jobs it will make is less than the jobs that will be lost. 
Also cutting tax to wealthy class or 
business people should come with constraints of employment to automatically 
concentrate on the whole countries 
financial issue and employment. Also investments and concentration on 
Research and development, innovation and small 
business will lead to increase in employment.
3) Race Question: It can be done by giving equal opportunities to all races 
and legally taking action against 
those who discriminate. And create a community, having all races as 
employees in every sector, who will manage all the 
complaints related to race, which will be answered directly by the 
President and will run independently. And this community 
should be easily accessible. Educational system should also be targeted to 
teach kids to help remove race discrimination. 
Because the knowledge and habits at the early age is more effective. 
Problem of races is problem of all countries so the 
above things I mentioned is good at Presidential level but this is actual 
work of everyone of us.

This is just my opinion!"

Stop and frisk law isn't unconstitutional, it was where they were doing it 
that was. And New York murders are actually up."

realistic."
1071,1,BUUUURN TRUMP
1072,3,"Even JILL STEIN says in a recent interview ""HILLARY WILL START NUCLEAR WAR 
WITH RUSSIA BECAUSE OF HER POLICIES."" All other candidates in this election

1086,3,"i am a 13 year old girl who has just watched the debate on November the 2 
2016 that can realize that Donald J. Trump , is not good for the US ,not 
only because he belittles women but because he is going to make dictator of 
Korea Kim jong Un want to bomb us even more... then adults should realize 
it to. i do not like Hillary but she has expirence in the politcial system 
so she is better than trump but at this point in the election anyone 
is.watch Michelle obamas speech about human decency and how trump should 
not brag about sexually asulting women and you will want to think twice 
about your vote for trump. On November the eighth 6 days from now vote for 
Hillary Clinton. Again this is from a 13 year old girls prespective. If 
adults can't see this then america...START THINKING FOR ONCE! Vote Hillary 
for president If YOU want to ""Make America Great Again"". Vote for Hillary 
Clinton for the president of the United States of America."

1088,3,"I'm not a fan of Hillary or Trump but overall Hillary seemed more prepared 
for this debate and even took notes during it. However towards the end of

ISIS fast ASAP."

want Hillary to win!!!!!😂😂😂💯💯💯"
1090,4,"Republicans have a big lie , a racist, a bigot and a very stupid man named 
trump."
1091,4,"Trump and the republican are not good for the country, nor for the entire 
world. They are just racist, bigots, and idiots fearmongering and hating

stupid things but in all seriousness Hillary was there when Bill was the 
President and also when Obama was but nothing changed really. {ISIS was 
born.}"

policy sing right to a hell of a lot of Americans. But remember this if it

nation could ever have. That sexual predator must never win."

leader trump is just charlatan and a sexual predator."

1111,1,"I am not sure who is shittier. Killary or trumpster.
Can i trust trump that he will not start unnecessary wars against middle 
east countries? Can i even trust Killary?"
1112,3,"The ""Law and Order"" part is where I decided to vote for Hillary. She 
answered that question effectively. Trump just rambled saying ""law and 
order"" and ""stop and frisk"" while ignoring what's been said to be 
unconstitutional. Hillary even brought up mental health, more police 
training, etc. 

I tried very hard to look at both sides of this debate, without bias. Trump 
just seemed very unprepared and that's really not a trait (among many) 
commander in chief should posses."

and also turn them off when time is up."

1119,1,Trump u sure u wouldnt be bttr off as a comedian?
1120,0,"The fact that this is a presidential debate should bore me, but I am 
actually entertained by this because this was actually funny which is 
really troubling and makes me worry for America. Because frankly neither of 
them should be president they didn't talk about the future of the United 
States but just tried to roast each other. But please Americans whatever
