7,4,What on earth just happened.
8,4,"Honestly that was a first in US history in terms of pure bloodbath debates. I doubt we will ever see anything like that again. 

The fact that we are here with these two candidates is proof that like it or not, there is some divide in this country.

I can't believe I just watched that. "
9,2,Well there is a third debate. We may see worse!
10,0,"Recent history, maybe. You're forgetting 18th and 19th century debates where Congressmen would beat each other with sticks and challenge each other to pistol duels."
11,2,"Seriously, has no one read a single history book? If people think this was even remotely a ""bloody debate"" they're incredibly uninformed. "
12,3,"Yeah, Andrew Jackson would beat Trump over the head with his cane. And then Aaron Burr would shoot him."
13,3,"Jackson might support the whole ""send the illegals packing"" thing, though. Although in a much more violent fashion than I imagine Donald Trump plans.

26,0,The-rock-obama!
27,0,"Obama strolls out and waves both of them off the stage. Ya'll motherfuckers both go home, I'm tired of this shit. I'll be answering the rest of the questions here."
28,0,I read that in his voice and it was pretty rad.
29,0,"I liked it how Trump said ""Electing Hillary would be like four more years of Obama."". 


Obama is enjoying some extremely high approval ratings right now..."
30,1,"""She's horrible. Our leaders are horrible""

""Mr. Trump, what would you do differently? ""

""Not be horrible""

Lol"
31,3,"That's his answer to every question. ""Things are bad, so bad. I will fix them by being gooder. So much gooder."""
32,0,Bigly gooder.
33,0,"""All my words will be cromulent. Perfectly cromulent!"""
34,4,The word cromulent reminds me of a flaky pastry or baked good like croissant or cronuts.
35,0,"Literally all he says. ""It's horrible, tremendous failure, absolutely tremendous. I'm not going to be a failure. I will be the exact opposite of horrible."""
36,0,He'd rejigger the government. 
37,0,"Favorite ""incoherent rambling"" of the night regarding Trump tape:

>No, I didn’t say that at all. I don’t think you understood what was — this was locker room talk. I’m not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people. Certainly I’m not proud of it. But this is locker room talk.  You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have — and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times. We haven’t seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world. And they look and they see. Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS? And they look at our country and they see what’s going on. Yes, I’m very embarrassed by it. I hate it. But it’s locker room talk, and it’s one of those things. I will knock the hell out of ISIS. We’re going to defeat ISIS. ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment. And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS."
38,3,"I have to imagine his campaign spent hours upon hours workshopping and drilling his response to that specific question.  I was expecting the most stock ""I'm sorry, but it's not that big of a deal, and Hillary is bad too"" answer.  Never once did it cross my mind that he would just start talking about ISIS.  My jaw was hanging open during the whole answer."
39,0,"I don't know, this one was great too:    
""I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office. One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet. But I have no loans with Russia. You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have."""
40,4,I literally could not believe my ears when I heard that. Like WTF!!
41,0,"""He and I haven’t spoken and I disagree""

Pence:...... "
42,4,"lol and then Anderson was like ""...Did you just disagree with your running mate?""

I actually laughed at that part"
43,0,"*shakes head*

That's nonsense. He never said that."
44,0,"Pence: He didn't say that. 


Edit: Alternatively, ""You whipped out that 'I haven't spoken to my running mate' thing again.""

48,3,"I believe this gentleman had just asked the candidates if they each believed they could be a devoted president to all the people of the United States, which prompted Trump to go on a word salad voyage that as far as I could tell was about how black people all live in war zone ghettos."
49,1,"Everytime Trump spoke to a brown person he started rambling about inner city ghettoes, no matter what the question was"
50,0,Not entirely true! He also told a Muslim lady that she needs to report it whenever she sees bombs being made in her fellow Muslims' homes.
51,4,Looked like Samuel L. Jackson from Django. 
52,2,"My personal favorite image of the debate.

53,3,"Speaking of audience reactions, the guy to the left of the Muslim woman who asked about Islamophobia looked incredibly disgusted while Trump rambled on justifying Islamophobia."
54,3,It was truly amazing to see an Islamophobic answer to a question on Islamophobia.
55,1,"""Do you think Trump has the disposition to be president?""  
""No I...""

56,0,"Honestly, for a moment I thought she was just going to stop at 'no'."
57,0,"""No...He can have the rest of my time."""
58,4,"Sad she didn't just go ""See?"""
59,0,"I was waiting for it, such an opportunity."
60,2,That improvisation is the main thing her debate style is missing. Obama would have jumped on that one.
61,3,"I loved how quickly she came out with the ""no."" He'd barely finished the question. She didn't start with, ""Well, we've had a lot of opportunity to see my opponent blah blah blah."" Just a straight up NO right out of the gate. "
62,0,"That man from the audience who came up with the last question is the HERO WE DON'T DESERVE.

Edit: [Karl Becker for President] (http://i.imgur.com/GYbuun2.jpg)"
63,3,What was the question and general replies? I was flying and missed that portion. 
64,1,"Final question was to name something they respected about each other. Hillary respects Trump's children, Trump respects how Hillary never gives up.

Only question Trump answered well IMO."
65,3,"I thought they were both ok answers in terms of their content, but that Hillary framed her answer poorly. She should have said that she respects Trump because he has done well by his children and they have turned out to be wonderful people or something rather than starting with ""I respect his children""."
66,0,"She complimented in such a way that it couldn't be cut and used in a commercial, but they couldn't say she didn't compliment."
67,0,Funny considering how much he's slated her for lacking stamina tbh
68,0,It showed us a side to this election that I wish we saw more often.
69,0,Actual civility.
70,0,"The side of the election that I want to see more often is policy discussion. What direction that each candidate wants to take the country. They did a little of that but not nearly enough. Complimenting each other is not that. This debate, like the others, is theater.  Pandering to misinformed and ignorant ""undecideds"". 

Really? You're still undecided with such a contrast on stances? Or maybe undecideds don't want either, which I could see. But this is America, you only get TWO dumb choices. I expect many disenfranchised voters to skip the poles which is an advantage for Trump. "
71,0,Classic Carl
72,0,"Karl with a k, makes it better."
73,4,"And he sounded like he was choking up. I can understand the frustration of seeing two people, on of which will be the future POTUS, just saying completely negative things about each other and wanting to just hear something nice."

78,0,"I dunno, I think Alec Baldwin was too over the top to be believable this episode. "
79,0,"Ran a little long, but the cast really nailed their impersonations this time around. Baldwin's makeup team needs to back off the rouge a bit though. "
80,2,Ya cant wait for the 2nd presidential debate!
81,3,"I was genuinely expecting Trump to call Clinton a bitch on live TV, but saying he'd jail her was a pretty close 2nd"

88,3,"New slogan:

Vote for Trump : Better than ISIS"
89,0,"Vote for Pence: ""My role model is Dick Cheney"""
90,4,"He was very oddly resistant to answering that. I view it as Cooper lobbing him an easy one.

One of the biggest aspects of ""locker room talk"" is bragging about things that never happened. So Cooper gives him an easy opportunity to clarify and deny ever actually assaulting women. And instead, he talks about ISIS for another minute, and ignores Cooper's attempt to help him out, what, three different times? That's just a bad tactical decision; it makes you look like you're hiding something."
91,4,"The problem is this:  if he denies it flatly, then the media will just dig up what are probably numerous examples where women accuse him of doing what he just denied.  "
92,0,"It took 3 follow up questions for him to actually say he has not groped women. 2016, folks."
93,0,"Did he even really deny it?  It was so in passing, and he avoided saying it so many times, that I honestly don't even know if his wording counts as a denial.  "
94,0,That's so accurate I want to be groped by you
95,3,Can't wait to see Alec Baldwin Trump say this.
96,3,">Mr. Trump, you've said that discipline is important. ""If a leader doesn't have it, they won't be a leader for long."" But you've also tweeted that people should look at a sextape. Is that the discipline of a good leader?

>Wasn't a sextape. She says she'll be awake at 3AM as well. Tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communications. I have almost 25m followers. It's an effective form of communication. 

How is that even close to an answer?
"
97,0,"The worst part is that you could do this with literally every answer he had.
"
98,3,"No he worst part was where he didn't have the discipline to not interrupt her on a Question about discipline. 
"
99,0,That..is it all the worst part? Maybe it is all the worst part.
100,0,The worst part is where his supporters will think he won.
101,0,The worst part is that he has supporters.
102,0,Yes. Something was off about a lot of his answers. He had no substance. It was all puff. Classic demagoguery. 
103,0,"It was Billy Madison 2: The Presidential Candidate that Lost His Way.

Seriously, I wanted Anderson Cooper to respond with the whole, ""Mr. Trump, what you just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul."""
104,0,"Preach it,brother."
105,3,"Right? People are saying that it was close or that Trump did pretty well, and yet his responses are *literally nonsensical*. ***What the fuck.***"
106,0,"He's being graded on a curve. Everyone expected him to start screaming the N word, call her a bitch etc. Instead he just rambled incoherently. So by that measure he did better than last time.."

132,0,God dammit IS NOWHERE SAFE?
133,0,"""She didn't speak during your turn"""
134,3,I loved that. She let him say his whole god damn answer and only *then* did she repeat the question as if he hadn't said anything at all.
135,4,"Well if she'd interrupted halfway through, he could have said ""I'm getting to that"", and if he actually had it would have looked like he was being attacked. Waiting until he ""answered"" first removed that option for him."
136,0,"""Sure, and let me ignore it again."""
137,3,"This constant talking point from Trump that Clinton didn't do anything about taxes, or healthcare, and this or that. AS A SENATOR YOU DONT HAVE SOME MAGICAL UNILATERAL POWER TO CHANGE THE TAX CODE. This is the most obnoxious shit that Trump babbles about."
138,3,"It just shows how much Trump *hasn't thought* about how he would actually implement his policies.

Guess what: you don't become President and become supreme dictator.  You need to work with people *gasp*!  I honestly think he doesn't realize this, and this is why he makes ridiculous promises."
139,4,"He doesn't seem to understand the very basics of how government works. This is like a mechanic walking into a hospital and demanding they let him do open heart surgery. Like, yeah, there's valves involved in both, but there's a reason we require qualifications for important jobs."

169,0,Seems to be trying to say that one of his companies was given a contract to do/redo the old post office building in some fashion and that is somehow proof that he pays taxes and has no weird and/or conflicting business concerns. As if they choose a company based solely on their financials ( a weird thing to suggest) and that somehow his personal tax and money issues would be a part of company financial documents.

209,0,"That happened because there was a miscommunication between the cameraperson and the technical director, who operates the switcher. The director may have told the cameraperson to refocus the camera (which is done by zooming in and focusing on the subject's eye, hence the fast zoom in) but then told the tech director too late. So the cameraperson started zooming in to her face to refocus before the tech director switched shots."
210,0,"Anderson Cooper went all night without actually murdering a candidate. I'm a little disappointed. But Donald did threaten to imprison Hillary with a special prosecutor, whined about it being 3 on 1, disagreed with his VP and dodged the fuck out of the whole grabbing pussy deal.

224,0,"I can't hear him talk anymore. My brain just wants to devour itself trying to untie all the verbal knots he makes when speaking. Even when someone gives him a jumping-off point, he response bears no relevance to what was asked. "
225,4,"> My brain just wants to devour itself


That's actually a really good way to put it. Oftentimes I seriously can't understand what he's trying to say - he seems unable to organize his ideas logically. He's like a middle schooler writing an essay, just spitting out whatever comes to mind without any thesis or structure. "
226,4,"When grading, that stuff is just given the lowest grade, writes a vague comment like ""Needs to organize thoughts more clearly"" and the teacher moves on to the next essay. Seriously, I've seen way more coherent essays from students with English as their third language, or students with PTSD. Trump is just all over the place and each fragment of a thought has no relevance to anything else."
227,0,That's because he is not actually educated on the issues and is skirting around them waiting for the clock to run out.

233,3,"He complained about Clinton going ""a minute over"" on a question she spent 1:52 on. "
234,3,"Wow,  it did feel like Hillary did go over her time a lot but it's probably because Trump would always interrupt during her time. "

249,0,A military genius he is not. 
250,0,"Trump hasn't spoken to Pence about Syria - like, at all? And then he throws Pence under the bus over it? Wow - I wonder if this means Pence will be dropping out. Pence wants the 2020 run, and wants it badly. Getting talked down by his own freaking running mate on national TV is bad news for that.

Edit: Apparently Pence is tweeting that he's still on board. It'll be funny to see what he says about this in interviews!"

260,3,"Question: What would you prioritize in naming a Supreme Court Justice?

Clinton: We want good people with real life experience. People who tried more cases, people who understand what folks have gone against.

Trump: I ask Sec. Clinton, why isn't she funding her campaign with her own money and not money from special interests? Why aren't you putting money in? You've made a lot of it because you were in office, in Sec State? Why not?


*what?*"
261,3,"Mr Trump, you tweeted urging people to watch a sextape. Is that your idea of discipline?

""No I did not. Twitter is great. I have 25 million followers. Its a modern form of communication and its great.""

*What the fuck?*"
262,0,"By the way, the tweet that contains the exact phrase ""check out sex tape"" still exists. "
263,3,"> check out sex tape

I didn't even put in Trump's name.  I just searched for that phrase and the first link is an article with the tweet."
264,0,"He told Cooper not to downplay Twitter as if he was asking if using Twitter at 3am was an example of good discipline, not even understanding that it was about telling people to look up a sex tape. "
265,3,Trump didn't understand that the sex tape comment was the problem. You know since he's en enormous sexist. 
266,0,"This was most rambling, incoherent performance by a presidential candidate I have ever witnessed."
267,3,"Personally I think the discipline question was worse. Mr. Trump you tweeted to the public to check out a sex tape at 3am, is this good discipline?  
I never said sex tape! (he did) ... BENGHAZI"
268,0,"Jesus.

Fuck.

Yes.

I haven't watched all that many debates (I only became a citizen in 2008) but ...that was...in its own league, right?"
269,0,its unbelievable that he managed to get this far
270,0,"Yes, this election has been.... Exceptional.

You picked an awkward time to join up but... Uh.... Welcome!"
271,0,Yes it was insane.
272,0,"Yeah, this whole election has been a special kind of stupid"

""ISIS!!!!!!!!!!!""

Seriously. WTF."
279,3,Same here.  I see far too many people saying Trump won and I just don't understand.  I thought he was awful.  I thought he crashed and burned.  His only decent answer was to the last question. 
280,3,"It depends upon what you value - if you value information and facts than you think Hillary won. If you value bluster, you believe Trump won"
281,0,He never answers the questions with any specifics or policy ideas. 
282,0,Because he has none....
283,4,"I'd say give him at least a little credit. He has ideas, they're just really bad and not thought out."
284,4,"He has ideas of *outcomes* he'd like to see, but is missing that pesky part in the middle where you have to figure out how to get there. (Also his desired outcomes are horrifying)"
285,4,"1. Kick out people I don't like and build wall.
2. Lower taxes
3. ????
4. Profit"
286,0,Deflect and insult. That's his only strategy bc he has nothing to say
287,3,"Another thing I noticed is that Trump wasn't looking at the people who asked the question and stood pretty far from them. Hillary went straight to the edge of the circle, looked the people in their eyes, and talked. "
288,0,Sniffing intensifies.
289,0,Cocaine and cocaine accessories. 
290,0,"Trump said he will have his political opposition imprisoned, threw Pence under the bus, and admitted not paying 20 years of federal taxes... But the debates a draw? Did we watch different debates?"
291,3,The bar is set so freaking low by Trump that just the fact that he didn't take a swing at someone means that he did great in the eyes of most people.
292,1,"This is the real ""mainstream media bias"" that Trump supporters are so eager to circlejerk about.

Clinton is held to an impossibly high standard and Trump is widely praised for not completely fucking up.

EDIT: CNN, in an effort to appear ""fair"" and not seem as if they were going after Trump for his complete meltdown this last week (e.g., violation of the Cuban embargo, illegal activity re: his charity) loaded the debate with questions about Clinton's emails, etc. which were already adequately addressed at the previous debate. It was a complete farce."
293,0,"""I mean, she doesn't quit. Even after I win and put her in jail. She won't quit."""

296,3,"He thought he might score some points by not answering the last question in the same way Clinton did (she does not do short answers well at all), but candidates have to use that last debate question as a signoff to the American audience until next time.

301,0,"She never gives up.... But she has no stamina.


Ok Donald"
302,3,At least he answered the question properly.
303,4,"Guys, let's be real here. You can't like trump. Your whole defense of trump revolves around him being better than Hillary.

Sure a few diehards actually like his policy(or lack thereof) but you know that what you really like is that he isn't one of #them.

The #them that pervades American Politics. Politicians. He isn't Rubio. He isn't Cruz. He isn't Bush. He isn't Hillary. That's great. I like that he is different and I am happy that you are getting what you want.

But please think practically for a moment. He laid out next to #ZERO policy or planning. And he has shown himself as a terrible public speaker and personality. Foreign Governments who are our allies literally mock him in public. 

America needs someone who is strong and knows what they are doing. I am not a democrat. I identify as a progressive republican and a conservative socialist or something something of a mish mash. I am not a part of any party.

Please. He doesn't know what he is doing. And you can't justify that by saying Hilary is a bitch. "
304,3,"> He laid out next to #ZERO policy or planning.

Not true at all! Trump clearly stated that his plan is to ditch the current plan and replace it with a plan that works. That's the plan."
305,4,"Just because you hate the Heathers, doesn't mean you should let Christian Slater blow up the school. "
306,0,"Welp...I think Donald just made Pence's decision on leaving that much easier...

EDIT - Holy shit Pence you need to get far away from this man"
307,0,"No kidding... I mean, admitting to disagreeing with your running mate?

That's a good, clean shot in the foot right there."
308,0,I'm more concerned with the fact that he said THEY HAD NEVER DISCUSSED THE TOPIC!  The candidates for President and VP from a major party haven't discussed one of the biggest issues facing the country???
309,0,[removed]
310,0,"Still no discussion on climate change

We're fucking destroying ourselves"
311,0,"No in depth discussion, but Hillary gave a nod to it and talked about having an energy policy plan."
312,1,"While Trump totally ignored the ""environmental' part of that question and instead talked about how he would make sure the fossil fuel industries made bigger profits.   "
313,0,"Every election it's practically ignored, and it makes me sad. We don't deserve this planet"
314,0,"It was touched upon briefly at the end, but not enough."
315,0,"As a ""how will you save coal"" question. 

I work in the power industry and it pissed me off. Coal is dead. Let's dominate renewables. "
316,0,"I took the question to be what will you do to help the coal workers, not how you will save coal."
317,3,"True. Clinton hinted toward transition, Trump doubled down on coal"
318,2,We fucking need a shock collar for when they go over by ten seconds and if they state wrong facts for the final debate. Also no audience because they clearly are incapable of being adults. 
319,4,Do you want to be the one putting a shock collar on the future POTUS? Especially when one of them is talking about jailing people he doesn't like.
320,3,Stupid question -why don't they just cut their mics? Give them a 10 sec grace period and you're done. Also no mic when it's not your turn. Watch interruptions go to zero.

324,2,After this debate I'm confident Donald Trump does not know how the American government works. 
325,0,"""Why didn't you, as a senator introduce tax legislation."" Ignorant of the fact that the House introduces tax bills."
326,0,Ignorant at the fact that Hillary was not running the entire government for the last thirty years.
327,0,Yeah this has been pretty mind blowing to me. He basically said that every senator ever has been shitty because they couldn't pass all the policy they preferred.
328,0,"She should have repeated that she said, ""I voted to cut those loopholes but we had a Republican president.""  He spoke over that but it was a really good point!"
329,3,"He wants to target uneducated voters by attaching everything ""corrupt/establishment/bad"" on Clinton. Any mistake the government has ever made: Clinton. Person who never makes a mistakes: Trump."
330,0,"""Why weren't you running the entire government? All talk, no action folks. I will change that, believe me. Believe me."""
331,0,"WAIT YOU MEAN AMERICA HASN'T BEEN LED BY THE JUNIOR SENATOR FROM NEW YORK FOR EIGHT YEARS!?

this changes everything..."
332,0,But remember she's been fighting ISIS for her entire adult life.
333,0,"Damn she should've jumped on it, ""Actually, Donald, the House of Representatives introduces tax bills -- did you know that?"""
334,0,"But then people would have called her a condescending bitch. I think she handled it well enough. People know that as one person in the senate, you can't do it all... right?"
335,3,You're putting a lot of faith in the 40~% of people voting for Trump.
336,0,The problem is that his supporters don't either... so him saying stupid shit doesn't matter to them
337,0,He thinks a senator can unilaterally make laws and change the tax code. He has no concept of even the most basic facts about our government. 
338,0,"He probably knows that, but to a lot of people his argument will make sense."
339,0,"If you showed this to someone not familiar with American politics, the person would think Hillary was president ever since 1992."
340,0,You mean being a Senator doesn't make you dictator in chief? 
341,0,and that's really where the biggest issue lies and is why Clinton is objectively a better choice.
342,0,"I mean his bullshit about 30 years.  You mean as a single Senator, you couldnt unilaterally get the taxes fixed and pretty much every other problem with the country????  How can anyone be so damn naive WHEN THEY ARE RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY?"
343,3,"That's cos Trump is just a reality TV host, he has no experience in politics. Trusting him to control a country is almost suicide."
344,3,"It's so weird how people forget that.  They wouldn't trust the Kardashians to balance their checkbooks, but think Donald Trump can effectively lead the country.  

I don't really get it.  I understand the desire for something different, but Trump?  Really?"
345,0,"Can't believe Senator Clinton didn't change the tax code.

if you own a single flag based piece of clothing, you do not have a choice in this election. **That flag stands for something. It stands for the United States Constitution, which Trump does not know anything about because the Founding Fathers forgot to write a pussy into it.**"
348,3,"His ignorance on foreign policy is what kills me. He thinks we couldve just ""snuck into"" Mosul and taken it? The question given to Hillary asking if she would be for putting ground troops into Syria and she immediately said, ""no and that it would be a terrible mistake"" is how incredibly different these two people view the world. I am a veteran of Afghanistan and do not want the US sending in ground troops to any location that doesn't pose a direct threat to us. Putting in ground troops in this Syrian/Russian/Iran shit storm is incredibly naive and Trump thinks it's just that simple. Ban Muslims, tax breaks for corporations, and his vast ignorance on foreign policy... How in the hell can anyone consider voting for Trump? The dude is literally a suit-wearing, entitled, fascist cancer."
349,0,"First of all, I think that you are entirely correct. I also am a veteran of Afghanistan and Trump seriously scares me. I posted this elsewhere, but I think that it should be a part of the conversation:

I think that it's important to remember that we are electing the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. For many years(understatement) we have struggled within our military to combat sexual harassment and assault. Even as recently as 2014 our military leaders have [specifically targeted ""what defense officials called 'locker room talk,' because those behaviors show a strong correlation to sexual assault.""](http://thehill.com/policy/defense/195083-military-cracks-down-on-locker-room-talk-at-academies) We need to consider and discuss what the effects of electing a Commander in Chief who makes comments advocating sexual assault, then justifies those remarks as ""locker room talk."" Not only does it tell our soldiers that it's alright to objectify and abuse women, but it justifies the broader scope of ""locker room talk"" which the military is already attempting to curtail. How can you tell a Private in the Army that he can't make sexually aggressive comments when he can go online and see the man at the top of his chain-of-command saying the exact same thing and excusing it as acceptable talk for men-among-men. You can't. The damage is already done and whether he was fit to be President or not, this alone should be enough to consider him unfit."
350,0,"> A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SAID HIS FIRST ACT IN OFFICE WOULD BE TO START A TRUMPED-UP CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION TO LOCK UP HIS OPPONENT

The scary thing is that it seems like that was his supporters favorite part of the debate. "
351,0,"""Mrs. Clinton, please tell the audience something that you respect about your opponent, your opponent that is on video boasting about using his star power to sexually assault women.""

There's a lot of internet back-patting for this question but, for all of the reasons that you have described, it was fucking absurd.

If I remember correctly, it's what got the biggest laugh out of Clinton too. Who can blame her?"
370,0,"He said she had hate in her heart. In a Trump op ed he about those 5 teens that were accused of murdering a woman he said something like ""Maybe what America needs is more hate"". "

395,3,"Highlights

• No handshake surprised everyone I think. I wonder if their campaigns discussed this beforehand.

• Trump looked constipated and defeated from the get-go. Adopted a soft voice but couldn't help himself and settled into his usual aggression early on.

• Return of the sniffing.

• Anderson Cooper and Martha Raddatz came prepared and took no shit.

• A reality TV star dragged up rape claims against a former President in front of his wife and millions of people… and that cut to Bill's shocked face... what a time to be alive.

• So much petulance from Trump about time limits throughout. 

• ""If I were President at that time, [Captain Khan] would have been alive today.""

• Trump's genius military plan to defeat ISIS: ""Make it a sneak attack"".

• Probably the best soundbite of the night: ""Because you'll be in jail"".

• No knockout blow from Hillary but at this point her opponent has already been carried from the ring and is on his way to the morgue. 

• That last question. Name something positive that you respect about your opponent. Amazing. 
"
396,3,"> • Trump's genius military plan to defeat ISIS: ""Make it a sneak attack"".

THIS is actually super important. The reason cities get warnings before they are attacked is so that civilians get the chance to flee should they choose to do so! It's a god damn humanitarian measure and I sooo wish Clinton would have mentioned it. Shows how little Trump knows or, even worse, how careless he is with the life of others.


Edit: I am told Raddatz mentioned it, which I missed and I think a lot of people did. It's a shame."
397,0,"Yeah, but Raddatz mentioned it, so at least someone stood up for protecting innocent civilians.... "
398,0,"Bizarrely the moderator mentioned it, which was nice. "
399,0,"I know the moderator called him out on it, and I think they didn't give Hillary a chance to respond to that directly. I, too, was hoping she'd mention that the reason cities are given advance notice is to evac civilians, and then follow up with, ""Osama bin Laden was given his notice in-person."""
400,0,"Best soundbite was

""So why didn't you?""

""Because I had a Republican President."""
401,0,Also if a single senator can just make really important shit happen on their own that would be bad because that means that a single senator could make everything to to hell on their own.
402,0,"And after he sniffled that she would have made it happen if she were a strong Senator

""We have a little thing in this country called the President having a veto..."""
403,0,"I dunno I personally loved ""I'm a gentleman"" (and then that getting a laugh from the audience, holy shit!) and ""nobody has more respect for women than me"""
404,0,He really demonstrated how little he knows in regards to how government actually functions on that one.
405,0,They did shake hands at the end. 
406,0,Would have been pretty hard to go from a question about complimenting your opponent to not even shaking hands with them
407,0,"Because you'd be in jail.

Wow."
408,0,"I thought that the last question was an interesting way to close the debate, and that it shows how the media want to frame this next week of news and election coverage."
409,3,"I've never seen grading on a curve like this before. Well, he didn't shit all over himself or yell any racial epitaphs at the camera. Quite the performance. Trump wins!"
410,0,Is he saying that Hillary Clinton has... excellent stamina?
411,0,I just want to know if this pence rumor is true. I can only get so erect 
412,0,What on earth is with his sniffing all the time? Both debates now?
413,0,Cocaine 
414,0,"He has terrible breath control. He's talking out his mouth, runs out of breath and inhales sharply to continue speaking. If he would simply slow down and catch his breath he wouldn't have to sniff so hard."
415,3,"He had a terrible mic, just terrible. Once again he was sabotaged by the sound technicians, who decided to give him a terrible mic that was good enough to pick up his breathing!

Probably because they're Hillary supporters who were stiffed by Trump by doing a bad job for him.

/sarcasm"
416,3,"Trump came off as a terrifying right wing despot riddled with paranoia, ignorance, and arrogance who is only capable of deflecting to others.

Hill was very measured and articulate. It's a shame she only gets 2 minutes to answer complex af questions.

Also:

> I'm not unproud of it

> give people economics 

good job with the good talking, trump"
417,3,As an independent I thought Clinton did well. Trump really didn't answer any questions. Clinton isn't emotional but at this point I rather take her than Trump.
418,0,Not emotional is a good trait for a leader to have imo
419,0,Do we want an emotional president?
420,0,Lmao that was my reaction too reading the comment. 
421,3,Trump never answers questions
422,4,"I feel like ""isn't emotional"" is a good quality."
423,3,"As someone who has always associated myself more closely with the political right (albeit not on social issues), I still can't believe the GOP nominated Trump, the epitome of all the negative stereotypes liberals and Democrats have of the GOP. I can't wait for November 8th- I hope it truly destroys the ambitions of this segment of the political right in the US for at least a decade."
424,3,"I'm a Republican who is voting for Hillary after seeing the debate. I'm not alone; some of my more conservative friends and family are as well. Previously, I wasn't voting at all. I don't agree with some of her policies, but Trump is a nightmare. I can't stand by and watch him become our next President."
425,3,Donald Trump sounded like me when I haven't bothered to prepare for a presentation and I'm just BSing my way through it.
426,0,"it's so irksome to see people complaining about the candidates not talking policy and placing the blame equally on both their shoulders.

like, how can anyone seriously think that Hillary wouldn't **love** to discuss the differences in their tax plans or healthcare plans or in-depth foreign policy? but meanwhile, Trump is showing up to the debate trying to get Bill Clinton's possible-rape-victims placed in the ""family box"" on stage."
427,0,A campaign manager just had to clarify that she's never been assaulted or harassed in a sexual manner by the candidate whose campaign she's managing. She also used that fact to say the candidate is not a bad guy.

429,4,"I like how one of the few times Hillary even did interrupt, she apologized for it. "
430,3,So trump got a question from an old dude about being inclusive and started going on about the inner city because old dude happened to be black?
431,3,Legitimate query:  Did Trump answer a single direct question?  He kept deflecting all over the place.

439,3,"I'm a NeverTrump conservative Republican. I think Clinton won yet again. Trump ran all over the place with multiple tangents. He threw his own VP under the bus and reversed what he said concerning Russia last week. Trump praised dictators in Russia and Syria. 

It might have been good enough to stop the GOP support bleeding from him. But that probably hurts the Republican Party more than it helps. If he had totally imploded, we would probably be in better positioned to either try to oust him (and fail) or pull the plug on his campaign. "
440,3,Can we just take a moment to thank Anderson Cooper for picking that last question in such a nasty election?
441,0,"His answer on Islamophobia was disturbing. He basically blames Islam for it, then repeatedly says Muslims need to keep an eye on each other and report suspicious behavior. That is not a policy, nor a solution to Islamophobia, that is authoritarian ""report your neighbors"" fearmongering."
442,1,"I have an honest question, does Trump know that the senate is filled with more than one person?  Instead of attacking what she didn't pass why not attack what she voted for?"

Someone has to get a clip of that to put online."
447,3,Trump has always had frightening policies but this is the first time that I saw Trump and he made me exceedingly uncomfortable and frightened. I just couldn't sit still while he was talking and he just made me anxious and twitchy.
448,0,When he kept talking about how we should do a sneaky secret mission in the middle of the night to kill all the leaders I couldn't take it. You don't think we would have done that if we could? 
449,3,"I just have to say, Hillary must have nerves of steel to be completely unfazed by everything Trump had to say about her. I guess dealing with republicans for 20+ has made her immune to anything they throw at her.  "
450,3,"Trump focused way too much on Hilary as a person and everything he critiqued about her actual policy was either misleading, off-base or a flat-out lie."
451,0,"He doesn't have much in the way of policy anyway. It was always, ""I can do better. Trust me."""
452,0,"Kenneth Bone is the hero we deserve, but not the hero we need right now."
453,3,"Have people really lowered their standards so far that Trump not dropping an N-bomb is enough for them to say he did well? He has no plans, no policies, and as much understanding of politics both international and domestic as my 8 year old niece. He casually threw out insults in the hope that he could make her cry and claim victory by doing so and when he attempted to discuss the issues he come off as being marginally less insane the average ranting homeless man. What debate are people watching where they can say he did well or won?"
454,1,Trump's response to combating Islamophobia was Islamophobic. 
455,1,Who saw that tweet where Trump called hillary the devil and a lady in the undecided voter section just reacted negatively. I can imagine most of the female voters were extremely turned off by Trump tonight.

460,3,"According to a CNN poll 57% of people thought Hillary won 34% thought Trump won. 

Now I'm not sure but my guess is the other 9% were unable to vote as they probably died of alcohol overdose before the debate ended... 

"
461,0,Clinton yet again comes off as well-educated and informed and Donald looks like he is just going to wing this whole presidential thing.
462,0,I think the Mike Pence bit is going to hit republican supporters hard.
463,2,I think that is something that gets worse in the day after the debate compared to immediately 
464,0,What happens if a VP quits before the election? Has that ever happened?
465,3,"I keep reading that Trump didn't have a meltdown and Clinton was the same as always but missed a few opportunities so it was more or less a tie.....am I missing something?? Clinton lays out a comprehensive knowledge of global issues, and comprehensive plans for how to handle things in America. Trump doesn't really answer questions, spends most of his time being critical of what has happened with no nuance, and when he does lay out something, it's like a jot note in lieu of a plan and it's either to give rich people more money and fewer regulations which will somehow magically benefit the low and middle class, or by creating more competition with those lower taxes prices for stuff will be kept low. Am I crazy, or isn't that all that's being said in amongst the gibberish? And don't we already know that neither of those things work? And if all that is true, then how was that a tie?"
466,0,I 100% agree. I feel like I watched a different debate than everyone. He didn't lay out a single plan or really answer a question. Even if you don't like Hillary at least she attempts to tell you her plans.
467,3,"Yes! I don't ""like"" Hillary, but I dislike her slightly less each time I watch one of these for the simple fact that she obviously works really hard at doing the work that's required. I would much prefer a more left-leaning candidate, but at least she understands how the different levels of American government work, and is aware of the complexities of international issues. 

I want to hope that in the next 24 hours of sound bites it'll be very clear that Trump didn't answer a bunch of really important questions, and that he's very much out of his league. I want to hope that. But NBC's first comment was about Trump pressing Hillary about Bill, so it might just be another shit show. 

*edit: too dumb to spell after having been exposed to Trump for an hour and a half"
468,0,"Again, let's be clear, that was not locker room talk. That is not what most guys say, nor how they act, even in private. It says something about the men who agree that's normal. As a guy, I'm offended. "
469,4,"Trumps wants to throw political enemies in jail, just being a strong leader like Putin"
470,3,"Amazing how Trump completely dodged the question regarding his little ""locker room talk"" video. He just transitions into talking about ISIS--really? Is this a fucking South Park sketch? How do people back this man?"
471,4,"How long is Pence gonna put up with his abuse?  Don't like the guy, but holy fuck.  Wasn't expecting that."
472,4,"""I consider that a great compliment. I don't know if it was intended to be...""

What a pathetic move. So obviously attempting to incite conflict in response to a comment that clearly reflected how incredibly sick of conflict we all are. It's just the perfect example of how inflammatory and petty he is."
473,0,Nobody is talking about the fact he admitted that he paid zero taxes.
474,0,"I think undecided women voters are really going to side with Hilary after this one.  The way he was talking to her, standing behind her looking down at her, pointing at her, was just really fucking creepy."
475,1,"CNN poll: Trump beat low expectations, Clinton still beat him solidly."
476,1,The Trump N word video to be dropped tomorrow am.
477,0,Kelly Anne is going to end up aging as much in these few months as Obama did in his 8 years.
478,0,The way he was awkwardly pacing up and down and having a weird body language really bothered me. Talk about looking presidential. 
479,0,"Did anyone else notice that Donald was sniffing a lot more during this debate than the last one or are my speakers playing up?

(I'm not saying he has a substance abuse problem. Or maybe he does.  A lot of people are saying that,  I don't know, I'm hearing it from smart people, the best people. Folks, believe me.)

484,0,That has to be one of the worst debate performances that I've ever seen. Trump didn't even answer most of the questions and behaved like an angsty teenager.

502,4,"Honestly that was a first in US history in terms of pure bloodbath debates. I doubt we will ever see anything like that again. 

The fact that we are here with these two candidates is proof that like it or not, there is some divide in this country.

I can't believe I just watched that. "
503,2,Well there is a third debate. We may see worse!
504,0,"Recent history, maybe. You're forgetting 18th and 19th century debates where Congressmen would beat each other with sticks and challenge each other to pistol duels."

One of the biggest aspects of ""locker room talk"" is bragging about things that never happened. So Cooper gives him an easy opportunity to clarify and deny ever actually assaulting women.

605,0,God dammit IS NOWHERE SAFE?
606,0,"""She didn't speak during your turn"""

608,4,"Well if she'd interrupted halfway through, he could have said ""I'm getting to that"", and if he actually had it would have looked like he was being attacked. Waiting until he ""answered"" first removed that option for him."

634,0,Seems to be trying to say that one of his companies was given a contract to do/redo the old post office building in some fashion and that is somehow proof that he pays taxes and has no weird and/or conflicting business concerns. As if they choose a company based solely on their financials ( a weird thing to suggest) and that somehow his personal tax and money issues would be a part of company financial documents. It's a weird nonsensical point. It's so absurd it's more incriminating than saying nothing about it.

678,4,"> My brain just wants to devour itself


That's actually a really good way to put it. Oftentimes I seriously can't understand what he's trying to say - he seems unable to organize his ideas logically. He's like a middle schooler writing an essay, just spitting out whatever comes to mind without any thesis or structure. "
679,4,"When grading, that stuff is just given the lowest grade, writes a vague comment like ""Needs to organize thoughts more clearly"" and the teacher moves on to the next essay.

686,3,"He complained about Clinton going ""a minute over"" on a question she spent 1:52 on. "

707,3,"> check out sex tape

I didn't even put in Trump's name.  I just searched for that phrase and the first link is an article with the tweet."
708,0,"He told Cooper not to downplay Twitter as if he was asking if using Twitter at 3am was an example of good discipline, not even understanding that it was about telling people to look up a sex tape. "
709,3,Trump didn't understand that the sex tape comment was the problem. You know since he's en enormous sexist. 
710,0,"This was most rambling, incoherent performance by a presidential candidate I have ever witnessed."
711,3,"Personally I think the discipline question was worse. Mr. Trump you tweeted to the public to check out a sex tape at 3am, is this good discipline?  
I never said sex tape! (he did) ... BENGHAZI"

Fuck.

Yes.

""ISIS"""

""ISIS!!!!!!!!!!!""

Seriously. WTF."
723,3,Same here.  I see far too many people saying Trump won and I just don't understand.  I thought he was awful.  I thought he crashed and burned.  His only decent answer was to the last question. 
724,3,"It depends upon what you value - if you value information and facts than you think Hillary won. If you value bluster, you believe Trump won"
725,0,He never answers the questions with any specifics or policy ideas. 
726,0,Because he has none....
727,4,"I'd say give him at least a little credit. He has ideas, they're just really bad and not thought out."
728,4,"He has ideas of *outcomes* he'd like to see, but is missing that pesky part in the middle where you have to figure out how to get there. (Also his desired outcomes are horrifying)"
729,4,"1. Kick out people I don't like and build wall.
2. Lower taxes
3. ????
4. Profit"
730,0,Deflect and insult. That's his only strategy bc he has nothing to say
731,3,"Another thing I noticed is that Trump wasn't looking at the people who asked the question and stood pretty far from them. Hillary went straight to the edge of the circle, looked the people in their eyes, and talked. "
732,0,Cocaine and cocaine accessories. 
733,3,The bar is set so freaking low by Trump that just the fact that he didn't take a swing at someone means that he did great in the eyes of most people.
734,1,"This is the real ""mainstream media bias"" that Trump supporters are so eager to circlejerk about.

Clinton is held to an impossibly high standard and Trump is widely praised for not completely fucking up.

EDIT: CNN, in an effort to appear ""fair"" and not seem as if they were going after Trump for his complete meltdown this last week (e.g., violation of the Cuban embargo, illegal activity re: his charity) loaded the debate with questions about Clinton's emails, etc. which were already adequately addressed at the previous debate. It was a complete farce."
735,0,But she has no sta-mi-na
736,3,"He thought he might score some points by not answering the last question in the same way Clinton did (she does not do short answers well at all), but candidates have to use that last debate question as a signoff to the American audience until next time. He just signed off with ""She's got guts and she's tenacious,"" without contrasting himself as the right choice in the very next breath."
737,0,"He started it by saying, ""I agree with everything she said."""
738,3,At least he answered the question properly.
739,3,"> He laid out next to #ZERO policy or planning.

Not true at all! Trump clearly stated that his plan is to ditch the current plan and replace it with a plan that works. That's the plan."
740,4,"Just because you hate the Heathers, doesn't mean you should let Christian Slater blow up the school. "
741,0,"No kidding... I mean, admitting to disagreeing with your running mate?

That's a good, clean shot in the foot right there."
742,0,I'm more concerned with the fact that he said THEY HAD NEVER DISCUSSED THE TOPIC!  The candidates for President and VP from a major party haven't discussed one of the biggest issues facing the country???
743,0,"No in depth discussion, but Hillary gave a nod to it and talked about having an energy policy plan."
744,1,"While Trump totally ignored the ""environmental' part of that question and instead talked about how he would make sure the fossil fuel industries made bigger profits.   "
745,0,"Every election it's practically ignored, and it makes me sad. We don't deserve this planet"
746,0,"It was touched upon briefly at the end, but not enough."
747,0,"As a ""how will you save coal"" question. 

I work in the power industry and it pissed me off. Coal is dead. Let's dominate renewables. "
748,0,"I took the question to be what will you do to help the coal workers, not how you will save coal."
749,3,"True. Clinton hinted toward transition, Trump doubled down on coal"
750,4,Do you want to be the one putting a shock collar on the future POTUS? Especially when one of them is talking about jailing people he doesn't like.
751,3,Stupid question -why don't they just cut their mics? Give them a 10 sec grace period and you're done. Also no mic when it's not your turn. Watch interruptions go to zero. 
752,0,He is in the hospital getting the knife in his back taken out
753,0,"""Why didn't you, as a senator introduce tax legislation."" Ignorant of the fact that the House introduces tax bills."
754,0,Ignorant at the fact that Hillary was not running the entire government for the last thirty years.
755,0,Yeah this has been pretty mind blowing to me. He basically said that every senator ever has been shitty because they couldn't pass all the policy they preferred.
756,0,"She should have repeated that she said, ""I voted to cut those loopholes but we had a Republican president.""  He spoke over that but it was a really good point!"
757,3,"He wants to target uneducated voters by attaching everything ""corrupt/establishment/bad"" on Clinton. Any mistake the government has ever made: Clinton. Person who never makes a mistakes: Trump."
758,0,"""Why weren't you running the entire government? All talk, no action folks. I will change that, believe me. Believe me."""
759,0,"WAIT YOU MEAN AMERICA HASN'T BEEN LED BY THE JUNIOR SENATOR FROM NEW YORK FOR EIGHT YEARS!?

this changes everything..."
760,0,But remember she's been fighting ISIS for her entire adult life.
761,0,"Damn she should've jumped on it, ""Actually, Donald, the House of Representatives introduces tax bills -- did you know that?"""
762,0,"But then people would have called her a condescending bitch. I think she handled it well enough. People know that as one person in the senate, you can't do it all... right?"
763,3,You're putting a lot of faith in the 40~% of people voting for Trump.
764,0,The problem is that his supporters don't either... so him saying stupid shit doesn't matter to them
765,0,He thinks a senator can unilaterally make laws and change the tax code. He has no concept of even the most basic facts about our government. 
766,0,"He probably knows that, but to a lot of people his argument will make sense."
767,0,"If you showed this to someone not familiar with American politics, the person would think Hillary was president ever since 1992."
768,0,You mean being a Senator doesn't make you dictator in chief? 
769,0,and that's really where the biggest issue lies and is why Clinton is objectively a better choice.
770,0,"I mean his bullshit about 30 years.  You mean as a single Senator, you couldnt unilaterally get the taxes fixed and pretty much every other problem with the country????  How can anyone be so damn naive WHEN THEY ARE RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY?"
771,3,"That's cos Trump is just a reality TV host, he has no experience in politics. Trusting him to control a country is almost suicide."
772,3,"It's so weird how people forget that.  They wouldn't trust the Kardashians to balance their checkbooks, but think Donald Trump can effectively lead the country.  

I don't really get it.  I understand the desire for something different, but Trump?  Really?"
773,0,"Can't believe Senator Clinton didn't change the tax code.

776,3,"His ignorance on foreign policy is what kills me. He thinks we couldve just ""snuck into"" Mosul and taken it? The question given to Hillary asking if she would be for putting ground troops into Syria and she immediately said, ""no and that it would be a terrible mistake"" is how incredibly different these two people view the world. I am a veteran of Afghanistan and do not want the US sending in ground troops to any location that doesn't pose a direct threat to us. Putting in ground troops in this Syrian/Russian/Iran shit storm is incredibly naive and Trump thinks it's just that simple. Ban Muslims, tax breaks for corporations, and his vast ignorance on foreign policy... How in the hell can anyone consider voting for Trump? The dude is literally a suit-wearing, entitled, fascist cancer."
777,0,"First of all, I think that you are entirely correct. I also am a veteran of Afghanistan and Trump seriously scares me. I posted this elsewhere, but I think that it should be a part of the conversation:

I think that it's important to remember that we are electing the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. For many years(understatement) we have struggled within our military to combat sexual harassment and assault. Even as recently as 2014 our military leaders have [specifically targeted ""what defense officials called 'locker room talk,' because those behaviors show a strong correlation to sexual assault.""](http://thehill.com/policy/defense/195083-military-cracks-down-on-locker-room-talk-at-academies) We need to consider and discuss what the effects of electing a Commander in Chief who makes comments advocating sexual assault, then justifies those remarks as ""locker room talk."" Not only does it tell our soldiers that it's alright to objectify and abuse women, but it justifies the broader scope of ""locker room talk"" which the military is already attempting to curtail. How can you tell a Private in the Army that he can't make sexually aggressive comments when he can go online and see the man at the top of his chain-of-command saying the exact same thing and excusing it as acceptable talk for men-among-men. You can't. The damage is already done and whether he was fit to be President or not, this alone should be enough to consider him unfit."

784,0,"He also said he hadn't talked with, and disagreed with, his running mate on a major issue."
785,0,"An issue that he was asked twice about, after giving a long, rambling non-answer the first time. "
786,0,"I honestly burst out laughing when he said ""she has evil in her heart."" Totally absurd
"
787,0,"That was the one that got me too.

If I remember correctly, it's what got the biggest laugh out of Clinton too. Who can blame her?"
788,0,"He said she had hate in her heart. In a Trump op ed he about those 5 teens that were accused of murdering a woman he said something like ""Maybe what America needs is more hate"". "
789,0,"Moreover, that he would *personally* arrange for it."

I sincerely appreciate it."

794,0,"Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if he actually tried to spin it that way at all. "

796,0,"He didn't want to say it, but he did"
797,0,"He also brought up that he wouldn't mention Hillary tweets at 3am... while defending that he was up at 3am, and claiming she wouldn't be... "
798,0,And revealing that it clearly went over his head that she was making fun of him when she sent out that tweet.

THIS is actually super important. The reason cities get warnings before they are attacked is so that civilians get the chance to flee should they choose to do so! It's a god damn humanitarian measure and I sooo wish Clinton would have mentioned it. Shows how little Trump knows or, even worse, how careless he is with the life of others.


Edit: I am told Raddatz mentioned it, which I missed and I think a lot of people did. It's a shame."
803,0,"Yeah, but Raddatz mentioned it, so at least someone stood up for protecting innocent civilians.... "
804,0,"Bizarrely the moderator mentioned it, which was nice. "
805,0,"I know the moderator called him out on it, and I think they didn't give Hillary a chance to respond to that directly. I, too, was hoping she'd mention that the reason cities are given advance notice is to evac civilians, and then follow up with, ""Osama bin Laden was given his notice in-person."""
806,0,"Best soundbite was

""So why didn't you?""

""Because I had a Republican President."""
807,0,Also if a single senator can just make really important shit happen on their own that would be bad because that means that a single senator could make everything to to hell on their own.
808,0,"And after he sniffled that she would have made it happen if she were a strong Senator

""We have a little thing in this country called the President having a veto..."""
809,0,"I dunno I personally loved ""I'm a gentleman"" (and then that getting a laugh from the audience, holy shit!) and ""nobody has more respect for women than me"""
810,0,He really demonstrated how little he knows in regards to how government actually functions on that one.
811,0,They did shake hands at the end. 
812,0,Would have been pretty hard to go from a question about complimenting your opponent to not even shaking hands with them
813,0,Cocaine 
814,0,"He has terrible breath control. He's talking out his mouth, runs out of breath and inhales sharply to continue speaking. If he would simply slow down and catch his breath he wouldn't have to sniff so hard."
815,3,"He had a terrible mic, just terrible. Once again he was sabotaged by the sound technicians, who decided to give him a terrible mic that was good enough to pick up his breathing!

Probably because they're Hillary supporters who were stiffed by Trump by doing a bad job for him.

/sarcasm"
816,0,Not emotional is a good trait for a leader to have imo
817,0,Do we want an emotional president?
818,0,Lmao that was my reaction too reading the comment. 
819,3,Trump never answers questions
820,4,"I feel like ""isn't emotional"" is a good quality."
821,4,"I like how one of the few times Hillary even did interrupt, she apologized for it. "
822,0,"He doesn't have much in the way of policy anyway. It was always, ""I can do better. Trust me."""
823,2,I think that is something that gets worse in the day after the debate compared to immediately 
824,0,I 100% agree. I feel like I watched a different debate than everyone. He didn't lay out a single plan or really answer a question. Even if you don't like Hillary at least she attempts to tell you her plans.
825,3,"Yes! I don't ""like"" Hillary, but I dislike her slightly less each time I watch one of these for the simple fact that she obviously works really hard at doing the work that's required. I would much prefer a more left-leaning candidate, but at least she understands how the different levels of American government work, and is aware of the complexities of international issues. 

I want to hope that in the next 24 hours of sound bites it'll be very clear that Trump didn't answer a bunch of really important questions, and that he's very much out of his league. I want to hope that. But NBC's first comment was about Trump pressing Hillary about Bill, so it might just be another shit show. 

*edit: too dumb to spell after having been exposed to Trump for an hour and a half"

831,0,"Recent history, maybe. You're forgetting 18th and 19th century debates where Congressmen would beat each other with sticks and challenge each other to pistol duels."
832,2,"Seriously, has no one read a single history book? If people think this was even remotely a ""bloody debate"" they're incredibly uninformed. "
833,3,"Yeah, Andrew Jackson would beat Trump over the head with his cane. And then Aaron Burr would shoot him."

That's actually a really good way to put it. Oftentimes I seriously can't understand what he's trying to say - he seems unable to organize his ideas logically. He's like a middle schooler writing an essay, just spitting out whatever comes to mind without any thesis or structure. "

968,3,"His ignorance on foreign policy is what kills me. He thinks we couldve just ""snuck into"" Mosul and taken it? The question given to Hillary asking if she would be for putting ground troops into Syria and she immediately said, ""no and that it would be a terrible mistake"" is how incredibly different these two people view the world. I am a veteran of Afghanistan and do not want the US sending in ground troops to any location that doesn't pose a direct threat to us. Putting in ground troops in this Syrian/Russian/Iran shit storm is incredibly naive and Trump thinks it's just that simple.

If I remember correctly, it's what got the biggest laugh out of Clinton too. Who can blame her?"
976,0,"He said she had hate in her heart. In a Trump op ed he about those 5 teens that were accused of murdering a woman he said something like ""Maybe what America needs is more hate"". "
977,0,"Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if he actually tried to spin it that way at all. "
978,0,"He also brought up that he wouldn't mention Hillary tweets at 3am... while defending that he was up at 3am, and claiming she wouldn't be... "
979,0,And revealing that it clearly went over his head that she was making fun of him when she sent out that tweet.
980,0,"And she was tweeting out a policy proposal, not an ad for a sex tape."
981,0,"All while totally missing the fact the the issue wasn't the *timing* of the tweets, it was their *content*"
982,0,[deleted]
983,0,"Yeah, but Raddatz mentioned it, so at least someone stood up for protecting innocent civilians.... "
984,0,"Bizarrely the moderator mentioned it, which was nice. "
985,0,"I know the moderator called him out on it, and I think they didn't give Hillary a chance to respond to that directly. I, too, was hoping she'd mention that the reason cities are given advance notice is to evac civilians, and then follow up with, ""Osama bin Laden was given his notice in-person."""
986,0,Also if a single senator can just make really important shit happen on their own that would be bad because that means that a single senator could make everything to to hell on their own.
987,0,"And after he sniffled that she would have made it happen if she were a strong Senator

""We have a little thing in this country called the President having a veto..."""
988,0,"I dunno I personally loved ""I'm a gentleman"" (and then that getting a laugh from the audience, holy shit!) and ""nobody has more respect for women than me"""
989,0,He really demonstrated how little he knows in regards to how government actually functions on that one.
990,0,Would have been pretty hard to go from a question about complimenting your opponent to not even shaking hands with them
991,0,Lmao that was my reaction too reading the comment. 
992,3,"Yes! I don't ""like"" Hillary, but I dislike her slightly less each time I watch one of these for the simple fact that she obviously works really hard at doing the work that's required. I would much prefer a more left-leaning candidate, but at least she understands how the different levels of American government work, and is aware of the complexities of international issues. 

I want to hope that in the next 24 hours of sound bites it'll be very clear that Trump didn't answer a bunch of really important questions, and that he's very much out of his league. I want to hope that. But NBC's first comment was about Trump pressing Hillary about Bill, so it might just be another shit show. 

*edit: too dumb to spell after having been exposed to Trump for an hour and a half"
993,0,Welcome to the Westworld
994,2,"Seriously, has no one read a single history book? If people think this was even remotely a ""bloody debate"" they're incredibly uninformed. "
995,3,"Yeah, Andrew Jackson would beat Trump over the head with his cane. And then Aaron Burr would shoot him."
996,3,"Jackson might support the whole ""send the illegals packing"" thing, though. Although in a much more violent fashion than I imagine Donald Trump plans.
"
997,0,"""All my words will be cromulent. Perfectly cromulent!"""
998,4,The word cromulent reminds me of a flaky pastry or baked good like croissant or cronuts.
999,1,"Everytime Trump spoke to a brown person he started rambling about inner city ghettoes, no matter what the question was"
1000,0,Not entirely true! He also told a Muslim lady that she needs to report it whenever she sees bombs being made in her fellow Muslims' homes.
1001,2,That improvisation is the main thing her debate style is missing. Obama would have jumped on that one.
1002,3,"I thought they were both ok answers in terms of their content, but that Hillary framed her answer poorly. She should have said that she respects Trump because he has done well by his children and they have turned out to be wonderful people or something rather than starting with ""I respect his children""."
1003,0,"She complimented in such a way that it couldn't be cut and used in a commercial, but they couldn't say she didn't compliment."
1004,0,Funny considering how much he's slated her for lacking stamina tbh
1005,0,"Vote for Pence: ""My role model is Dick Cheney"""
1006,0,That..is it all the worst part? Maybe it is all the worst part.
1007,0,The worst part is where his supporters will think he won.
1008,0,The worst part is that he has supporters.
1009,0,"Bro, thats motherfuckin' Ken Bone"
1010,0,[deleted]
1011,4,Yeah who decides to pass on the 1 when they can just run it in with Lynch....
1012,0,God dammit IS NOWHERE SAFE?
1013,0,"> But this is locker room talk. When we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, 

A true orator and statesman for the ages."
1014,0,[deleted]
1015,0,Seems to be trying to say that one of his companies was given a contract to do/redo the old post office building in some fashion and that is somehow proof that he pays taxes and has no weird and/or conflicting business concerns. As if they choose a company based solely on their financials ( a weird thing to suggest) and that somehow his personal tax and money issues would be a part of company financial documents. It's a weird nonsensical point. It's so absurd it's more incriminating than saying nothing about it.
1016,0,I love how this comment was unnoticed 3 days ago and now it is a national treasure. 
1017,0,"2016 may be a year of unmitigated disaster, but Ken Bone is a bright light in the darkness, a beacon for the world-weary and anxious.  "
1018,2,I love that right after the debate you hopped on Reddt and started commenting about the debate. You are a true American
1019,0,Mothafuckin' KEN BONE !! 
1020,0,"Oh my god you're Ken Bone!

Hello from the UK!"
1021,0,uhhhh that guy SUCKS
1022,0,"Hey it's me Kraftpunk.

Hey Kraftpunk...

Did you see I am running for President? (shoots cheese out of his vagina)

Get out! Get out of here!

Hannibal body checks

Enough! I hate that guy!"
1023,0,"I think he meant for total time spent talking, not the two minute clock. Might be wrong though"
1024,0,"I make comments, I make great comments, I know comments and I find yours amazing.

"
1025,0,"Because when he's pressured to answer specific policy questions, he flounders. Just look at when he was grilled on Aleppo. He fell apart. "
1026,0,"I can't hear him talk anymore. My brain just wants to devour itself trying to untie all the verbal knots he makes when speaking. Even when someone gives him a jumping-off point, he response bears no relevance to what was asked. "
1027,4,"> My brain just wants to devour itself


That's actually a really good way to put it. Oftentimes I seriously can't understand what he's trying to say - he seems unable to organize his ideas logically. He's like a middle schooler writing an essay, just spitting out whatever comes to mind without any thesis or structure. "
1028,4,"When grading, that stuff is just given the lowest grade, writes a vague comment like ""Needs to organize thoughts more clearly"" and the teacher moves on to the next essay. Seriously, I've seen way more coherent essays from students with English as their third language, or students with PTSD. Trump is just all over the place and each fragment of a thought has no relevance to anything else."
1029,0,That's because he is not actually educated on the issues and is skirting around them waiting for the clock to run out.
1030,0,I think the only actual thing he discussed policy wise was getting rid of state borders for health insurers. 
1031,2,"No it was *sniffle* instead of silence, there was no quiet moment in this debate "
1032,0,Grabs Pence by the penis.
1033,3,"> check out sex tape

I didn't even put in Trump's name.  I just searched for that phrase and the first link is an article with the tweet."
1034,3,Trump didn't understand that the sex tape comment was the problem. You know since he's en enormous sexist. 
1035,0,its unbelievable that he managed to get this far
1036,0,"Yes, this election has been.... Exceptional.

You picked an awkward time to join up but... Uh.... Welcome!"
1037,0,Yes it was insane.
1038,0,"Yeah, this whole election has been a special kind of stupid"
1039,0,"""Did you pay taxes?""

""ISIS!!!!!!!!!!!""

Seriously. WTF."
1040,3,"It depends upon what you value - if you value information and facts than you think Hillary won. If you value bluster, you believe Trump won"
1041,0,Because he has none....
1042,4,"I'd say give him at least a little credit. He has ideas, they're just really bad and not thought out."
1043,4,"He has ideas of *outcomes* he'd like to see, but is missing that pesky part in the middle where you have to figure out how to get there. (Also his desired outcomes are horrifying)"
1044,4,"1. Kick out people I don't like and build wall.
2. Lower taxes
3. ????
4. Profit"
1045,0,"I took the question to be what will you do to help the coal workers, not how you will save coal."
1046,3,"True. Clinton hinted toward transition, Trump doubled down on coal"
1047,0,Yeah this has been pretty mind blowing to me. He basically said that every senator ever has been shitty because they couldn't pass all the policy they preferred.
1048,0,"She should have repeated that she said, ""I voted to cut those loopholes but we had a Republican president.""  He spoke over that but it was a really good point!"
1049,3,"He wants to target uneducated voters by attaching everything ""corrupt/establishment/bad"" on Clinton. Any mistake the government has ever made: Clinton. Person who never makes a mistakes: Trump."
1050,0,"""Why weren't you running the entire government? All talk, no action folks. I will change that, believe me. Believe me."""
1051,0,"WAIT YOU MEAN AMERICA HASN'T BEEN LED BY THE JUNIOR SENATOR FROM NEW YORK FOR EIGHT YEARS!?

this changes everything..."
1052,0,But remember she's been fighting ISIS for her entire adult life.
1053,0,"But then people would have called her a condescending bitch. I think she handled it well enough. People know that as one person in the senate, you can't do it all... right?"
1054,3,You're putting a lot of faith in the 40~% of people voting for Trump.
1055,3,"It's so weird how people forget that.  They wouldn't trust the Kardashians to balance their checkbooks, but think Donald Trump can effectively lead the country.  

I don't really get it.  I understand the desire for something different, but Trump?  Really?"
1056,0,"First of all, I think that you are entirely correct. I also am a veteran of Afghanistan and Trump seriously scares me. I posted this elsewhere, but I think that it should be a part of the conversation:

I think that it's important to remember that we are electing the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. For many years(understatement) we have struggled within our military to combat sexual harassment and assault. Even as recently as 2014 our military leaders have [specifically targeted ""what defense officials called 'locker room talk,' because those behaviors show a strong correlation to sexual assault.""](http://thehill.com/policy/defense/195083-military-cracks-down-on-locker-room-talk-at-academies) We need to consider and discuss what the effects of electing a Commander in Chief who makes comments advocating sexual assault, then justifies those remarks as ""locker room talk."" Not only does it tell our soldiers that it's alright to objectify and abuse women, but it justifies the broader scope of ""locker room talk"" which the military is already attempting to curtail. How can you tell a Private in the Army that he can't make sexually aggressive comments when he can go online and see the man at the top of his chain-of-command saying the exact same thing and excusing it as acceptable talk for men-among-men. You can't. The damage is already done and whether he was fit to be President or not, this alone should be enough to consider him unfit."
1057,0,"An issue that he was asked twice about, after giving a long, rambling non-answer the first time. "
1058,0,"That was the one that got me too.

If I remember correctly, it's what got the biggest laugh out of Clinton too. Who can blame her?"
