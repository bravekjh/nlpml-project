Conversely, it gave Clinton an opportunity to really face the 'tough' questions and hammer home solid answers (though she certainly pivoted from a few questions I think we all would've liked some more direct answers to).

In total, I think the debate was a microcosm of what (some of) Fox News and mainstream conservatives feel about Trump and the election - they don't like Clinton, but they know Trump is an asshat and a terrible choice.

Why aren't the NATO questioned -- why aren't they paying? Because they weren't paying. Since I did this -- this was a year ago -- all of a sudden, they're paying. And I've been given a lot -- a lot of credit for it. All of a sudden, they're starting to pay up. They have to pay up. We're protecting people, they have to pay up. And I'm a big fan of NATO. But they have to pay up. She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great. Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.

I liked it a bit though, because I thought it cut to a lot of issues that GOP/Conservative voters have with Hillary and Trump, and while it should've helped Trump by being more in his supposed 'sweet spot', it was such an incoherent, rambling mess most the time, it completely eliminated the advantage.  Conversely, it gave Clinton an opportunity to really face the 'tough' questions and hammer home solid answers (though she certainly pivoted from a few questions I think we all would've liked some more direct answers to).

In total, I think the debate was a microcosm of what (some of) Fox News and mainstream conservatives feel about Trump and the election - they don't like Clinton, but they know Trump is an asshat and a terrible choice.  I thought Wallace did a service by giving questions that allowed Clinton to really speak directly to the fears of moderate conservatives, and really make her case as being a perfectly acceptable and reasonable candidate for President - not this crazy boogie man that the alt-right and hardliners have...trumped...her up to be.

Conversely, it gave Clinton an opportunity to really face the 'tough' questions and hammer home solid answers (though she certainly pivoted from a few questions I think we all would've liked some more direct answers to).

In total, I think the debate was a microcosm of what (some of) Fox News and mainstream conservatives feel about Trump and the election - they don't like Clinton, but they know Trump is an asshat and a terrible choice.

If the Republicans had actually nominated a semi-serious candidate, we would probably be having some very sharp and revealing policy discussion where Clinton and this imaginary Republican go toe to toe on where economic growth comes from, how to untangle Syria, and what can be done to improve race relations. We would here about body cameras, carbon caps, and entitlement reform like they were nothing.

930,"I think his framing was very much from a Conservative/GOP/Fox News sort of angle, which isn't a huge shock considering where he works.

I liked it a bit though, because I thought it cut to a lot of issues that GOP/Conservative voters have with Hillary and Trump, and while it should've helped Trump by being more in his supposed 'sweet spot', it was such an incoherent, rambling mess most the time, it completely eliminated the advantage.  Conversely, it gave Clinton an opportunity to really face the 'tough' questions and hammer home solid answers (though she certainly pivoted from a few questions I think we all would've liked some more direct answers to).

In total, I think the debate was a microcosm of what (some of) Fox News and mainstream conservatives feel about Trump and the election - they don't like Clinton, but they know Trump is an asshat and a terrible choice.  I thought Wallace did a service by giving questions that allowed Clinton to really speak directly to the fears of moderate conservatives, and really make her case as being a perfectly acceptable and reasonable candidate for President - not this crazy boogie man that the alt-right and hardliners have...trumped...her up to be.
