0,4,So it turns out that Obama's weird brother served no purpose at all. That's interesting.
1,2,Somehow Clinton found the strength not to be distracted by a man she's never met. 
2,2,It seems Trump forgot that he's not actually running against Obama.
3,4,Has he remembered that he's not running against Bill Clinton yet?
4,4,"Chris Wallace: *I know you didn't agree to closing statements, but fuck you both you're doing one.*

"
5,4,"Hillary: Fair enough, I have one because of course I do."
6,4,"Chris Wallace: I know you didn't prepare a closing statement...

Hillary: bitch I could recite to you 15 different closing statements right now. You could wake me from a drunken stupor and I could still give you like 9. "
7,4,I used to recite closing statements instead of bedtime stories to Chelsea.
8,0,"Mom I'm 20 and in college now

Shush dear I'm going to need you to fact check it in the morning"
9,0,Just go to my website where we have real time fact checking
10,2,"Trump: it's ok, even if you had given me prior notice, I wouldn't have prepared a closing argument. Hell, I haven't even prepared for any of the debates. "
11,0,"Hell, I haven't prepared for this election"
12,2,Hillary Clinton could legitimately run foreign policy better in a drunken stupor than Trump at his best.
13,2,"While giving her spheel you can see Trump scribbling down furiously. 

And he ended the debate saying he will stop African Americas form killing each other in the inner cities. "
14,0,Yeah. He can't seem to understand that equating minorities and the inner city is not the way to go. 
15,0,"At one point he actually said they're all poor and uneducated. 

He also failed to mention that chicagoans get all their guns by driving 20 minutes into the next county. 
"
16,0,Most guns involved in crime in Chicago originate in Indiana. If only Trumo knew the governor there!
17,0,spiel :)
18,4,"Watched that with friends and we all agreed that was about the best possible surprise question they could get.

Being POTUS means thinking on your feet, and keeping a sense of civility and decorum with you at all times."
19,4,"Republican candidate arguing for stricter regulations on businesses, Democratic candidate rattling sabers against Russia, Fox News having the fairest debate moderator....is this the mirror universe?"
20,0,"Welcome to the berenstain bear universe, things are different here. 
"
21,0,"Republicans defending Wikileaks and Democrats hunting them....it really is, it really is."
22,4,"Kellyanne Conway on CNN right now: ""Trump will accept the results of the election because he will win the election.""

edit: she just walked out on the interview in the spin room!

"
23,0,"When your campaign manager refuses to talk to the media after a debate, you know you just had a really really really catastrophically bad time."
24,0,Bigly
25,0,^^^^^^wrong
26,0,One could say you were...a disaster.
27,2,"She's a pollster, she sees the writing on the wall. And I don't think that she has a future if she helps Donald Trump with ... whatever he does when he loses."
28,0,She's so precious!
29,0,"The SNL skit about her really humanized her for me. It's a tough job, but someone's gotta do it."
30,2,"Anyone notice the part where Wallace was asking a question, giving context, and Trump interrupted with a big ""Correct"". 

And Wallace was llike ""Uh...Thanks, Now if I may continue...""?"
31,0,"""Well, I was gonna give you a chance, Donnie, but those rape accusations are coming up now.

...Fucker."""
32,2,"Trump's interruptions of Wallace were amazing.

He was pressing Clinton on the appearance of a conflict of interest with her Foundation, and her answer was not the best. But when he want back to press her again Trump came in and started talking about throwing gays off roofs, and Clinton was like ""hell yes Don let's change the topic to something insane."""
33,3,"Half of me is mad she didn't answer the question, but the other half of me applauded the fact that she was smart enough to recognize Donald's interruption as an easy way to get out of the corner she was in. Like her or not, girl's got mad debate skills."
34,3,"I'm honestly a little disappointed in all these debates. Clinton's biggest strength as a politician who is a major policy hawk, well read on every issue to an insane level, who usually doesn't give the time of day to anything else. Her main problem is that she doesn't really care about stuff like using private email servers, and she has had to study a lot on how to do the traditional bloviating politician shtick.

If the Republicans had actually nominated a semi-serious candidate, we would probably be having some very sharp and revealing policy discussion where Clinton and this imaginary Republican go toe to toe on where economic growth comes from, how to untangle Syria, and what can be done to improve race relations. We would here about body cameras, carbon caps, and entitlement reform like they were nothing.

Instead, we get this shit. Clinton is one of the smartest people out there and will be a much better President than she is a campaigner. If the GOP thinks they will have an easy time in 2020 they are in for a surprise."
35,2,"The best part was the reactions of both candidates. Trump honestly looked proud of himself, and Hillary was smiling to herself because the moderator had just subtly called out her opponent."
36,0,The smug look on trumps face was hilarious
37,0,"""Umm...I'm not sure we should be using 1950's television as a benchmark for what is or isn't offensive to say in 2016."" - Anderson Cooper 

lol....Jeffrey Lord is losing it on CNN"
38,0,But the 1950's was when America was great! /s
39,0,And when the highest tax bracket was 90%. These people are fucking stupid.
40,0,I love how they gloss over that so often.
41,0,"Wait, for real? 

I'm a filthy rube that actually doesn't know what the highest tax rate was in 1950."
42,0,"Yeah the highest bracket was super high up until Reagan slashed em. The way tax brackets work is e.g. : every dollar you earn 1-9.99MM is taxed at 35% every dollar after 10MM in that year is taxed at 90%. This is just an example but I wanna stress because lots get this wrong, at no time does making more money and getting taxed more mean that you make less net money."
43,0,"Australian here, lots of otherwise smart, normal people do not realise this. They complain about being pushed into a ""higher tax bracket"" as if it means they get less money."
44,0,My new favorite pastime is watching videos of Jeffrey Lord getting shit on by an entire panel.
45,0,"Ohhh but what was even better was he continued and said ""it's not as bad as the N word! Right?"" And leaned over to Van for support. Everyone then just let him float with no support on that.  I don't think I've ever laughed that hard in my life."
46,0,What'd he say?
47,4,"Jeffrey Lord was defending Trump's use of the term ""bad hombres"" and said he heard that on TV in the 50s all the time."
48,4,"He defended ""bad hombres"" as an inoffensive saying.  First, he said it's ""not as bad as the N word"".  Then, he followed that by saying that he hears people using it all the time.  When someone asked where he hears it, he cited ""1950s TV shows"". "
49,2,"Clinton: He was for the war

Trump: WRONG

Clinton: He said the primaries were rigged

Trump: WRONG

Clinton: He said Emmies were rigged

Trump: That one is legit"
50,0,This will be on the SNL cold open on Saturday.
51,0,[Hope it's as good as this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zbv-u1ml6g)
52,0,Priorities
53,0,"Can't believe he went back to ""wrong."" How do you think that's a good idea at this point? That wasn't doubling down, just makes you look afraid of what your opponent has to say."
54,0,Nasty Woman and the Bad Hombres would be a good band name
55,3,Nasty Woman sounds like a girl group Prince would have put together in the 80s
56,0,Big Lee on drums
57,3,Kellyanne Conway is on CNN. She looks like she started drinking halfway through the debate.
58,1,"""She always looks like the last ten minutes of Prom"""
59,0,"Damn, that's... I see it.
"
60,0,"The man trying to gain the votes of Republicans just criticized Ronald Reagan.

What the fuck has to be going through your mind to do that?"
61,4,Maybe its finally time that Republicans admitted what a big dirty liberal Reagan was.
62,2,"Clinton: ""...and you can google 'Donald Trump Iraq War' and hear for yourself the recording of Donald saying those very words.""

Trump: ""Wrong."""
63,0,"That was so excellent. Her previous ""Go to my website and read my fact checking!"" was canned and silly- which independent voter bloc is that going to sway? Tell them to Google it. It's 2016. You can't lie publicly and get away with it forever, because as soon as you see the video, you know he's a bullshitter."
64,3,She cut the super-obvious canned jokes/lines too. It's almost like she's running a normal campaign where the staffers pay attention and point out the stuff that doesn't work and the candidate actually listens to them. 
65,0,"My god, so glad she got rid of the Trumped up trickle down bullshit.  "
66,4,"The hillaryclinton.com shoutouts bothered me too, they didn't really appeal to an independent audience. Saying to just google it is much, much more effective.

If Hillary were half as nefarious as people love to suggest, she'd have SEO people working on the Trump results. With as tight a campaign she's been running, I wouldn't be surprised."
67,3,"I don't understand how you can run for president and not realize when you have a microphone attached to you people can replay what you said. Like when he denied making fun of the disabled reporter. 

His surrogates tried to play it off that it was OK he did it because he also made fun of other people. 

But he still denies he did it. Like I can't just YouTube the clip. "
68,0,On CNN two white people are telling a mexican woman she shouldn't be offended by comments aganst Mexicans and women.
69,2,"Something I noticed. There were several times where Clinton deflected from difficult questions by ending her statement with an attack on Trump. This would not have worked against a seasoned politician, but every single time this happened Trump ended up taking the bait and changing the conversation away from something that could have damaged Clinton towards a topic where he had to play defense. It was remarkable, truly."
70,0,"Agreed, he always rose to the bait. And thus spectacularly lost. "
71,4,Correct I noticed that too. Now...who do you want dealing with other world leaders when it comes to representing America? Donald or Hillary
72,3,Its like hillary had a previous job or two where she talked with world leaders all the time...
73,4,"Good point. I personally think she is playing to his weaknesses. I feel if she was up against a real politician it would be a lot more contentious though I think she would have an answer (or deflection).

When you're trying to wrangle a tiger, you try to avoid the teeth."
74,1,"Oh no, she was playing him like a fiddle. While I would have appreciated it if she had stood her ground more on a few things (what the hell is so awful about NAFTA specifically?) I feel like she effectively showed how much of a reactive punk Trump is."
75,2,That's because Clinton knows how to win a damn debate. She turned him inside out. 
76,2,"""Mr. Trump, what is your plan for improving the American economy?""

""WE WILL INSULT OUR ALLIES THEN ASK THEM FOR MONEY""
"
77,4,Oh! Have you met our president? -- Someone living in the Philippines
78,0,"""Once I started talking about it they started to spend the money""

Forgetting the fact that this was planned by NATO years ago..."
79,3,"Sometimes I feel like Trump thinks EU4 is real life. Saying ""why didn't we take all of Iraq's oil?"" like he's shift-clicking the money button in the peace deal"
80,2,"*The disputed succession of Hillary I has caused Reactionary rebels to rise up! They are led by Donald Trump, who styles himself The Donald, and they will stop at nothing to achieve their goals.*"
81,4,"*Right wingers are always superstitious, and the appearance of disastrous polling numbers for The Donald has caused panic among them. They are convinced that this is a sign that the end of times is near or that the election is rigged*

-1 stability"
82,4,"> 
""... But I'd like to start off where we left:  
When I said Japan and Germany--and I'm not to single them out, but South Korea--these are very rich powerful countries--Saudi Arabia nothing but money--we're protecting Saudi Arabia.

>Why aren't they paying? She immediately--when she heard this I questioned it--and I questioned NATO--why aren't the NATO questioned? Why aren't they paying--because they weren't paying.

>&nbsp;

>She comes out and says: ""We love our allies we think our allies are great!""  
Well... Its awfully hard to get them to pay up--when you have somebody saying we think how great they are. We have to tell Japan in a very nice way--we have to tell Germany--all of these countries--South Korea.  
We have to say: ""You have to help us out.""

83,4,"Worst moment of the debate: 

""I'll leave you in suspense"""
84,0,"I dunno if that beats:

* *I don't trust or believe US intelligence agencies*
* *What a nasty woman*
* *I didn't say that* SMASH CUT to him saying it
* *The Iraqis are attacking Mosul to help Hillary in the polls*
* *Hillary shouldn't be able to vote because I think she committed a crime, and the application of law and order and the constitution is at my whim*

He went full Infowars tonight, and I can count at least two or three attack ads that will just quote him, and he'll claim he never said any of it."
85,0,[removed]
86,2,Unprecidented in the history of American politics is Trump's middle name.
87,0,Junprecedented 
88,0,The J is silent.
89,4,Gore probably has the most legitimate case in history to contest a vote and even he bowed out gracefully.
90,0,"Although I agree that those are terrible, a presidential nominee refusing to state that he will abide by voter choice is literally a nightmare scenario in American politics. "
91,0,"What the fuck does that even mean? 

I'm not trying to be funny or anything. It's just so incoherent and idiotic.

What does it *mean*?"
92,4,"In the history of our nation, each losing candidate makes a concession speech. Every. Single. One. The moderator pretty much laid out the grounds, it is accepted as the norm - almost an unwritten rule if you will - and we move on as a nation. 

**Edit:** The moderator, not Clinton, pointed out that it is essentially custom.

Wallace: But sir, there's a tradition in this country of the peaceful transition of power, and no matter how hard fought a campaign is, the loser concedes to the winner - not saying you'll be the loser - and they come together for the good of the country."
93,2,Trump is very good with unwritten rules........*Tax returns* *cough cough*....uh *sniff*
94,4,"It means he can't answer yes or no, because if he wins, he'll accept the outcome.  If he loses, he's going to whine like a petulant child and declare it's a rigged outcome and The People shouldn't accept that Clinton won.  

From his POV, it's a trick question.  He can't say, ""I accept the outcome no matter what"" or ""I won't accept the outcome"", because it depends on who wins.  If Clinton wins, then it wasn't a real, legitimate election and the voters didn't really get their voice heard.  If he wins, then it's the will of the people and there's no sense challenging his victory."
95,0,[deleted]
96,3,"He's treating a US presidential election like reality TV because he's a narcissistic piece of shit. He doesn't care about the real world consequences, he just wants to tickle his ego. Fuck Republicans for giving this moron the power to have a national stage."
97,0,Horrifying.
98,4,"Oh its guaranteed at this point.  Trump does not give a fuck about what it means for a candidate to not concede.  To him its no big deal.  Frankly, he is just too stupid to realize WHY its important for the peaceful transfer of power."
99,0,Every single inaguration day it's celebrated how beautiful and important this is
100,0,It actually is. This is literally insurrection against the United States.  Accepting the peaceful transfer of power and election results is the foundation of our government. Take that away and we have nothing but chaos.
101,0,"Wow, Van Jones isn't taking any prisoners... 

>What we just got here was the nominee for a major party for the first time in our history signalling to the American people that he has so little faith in our institutions, he has so little faith in our people, he has so little faith in our courts, he has so little faith in our Republican Governors.. that he will not stand in front of his own country, in front of his own nation and say that he respects the process and the outcome. That is an outrage, the appalling lack of patriotism from this man, to stand there and praise Putin and Assad more than he has ever praised any American president.

https://twitter.com/CNN/status/788937779451396097"
102,0,"Honestly Van's best quote of the night was when he was discussing Hombres post debate. The female Hispanic pundant said she found it offensive and why, and the conservative pendants tore into about political correctness being bad.

Van sat there and said something along the lines of: If I tell you something is offensive, and you tell me, it is in the nature of civility that I try to understand how what I said was wrong. It used to be called civility. It wasn't called ""political correctness"" until others(hinting to minorities) started asking for it.

An absolutely perfect and succinct way to sum up the point. "
103,0,"I can sort of understand the logic of someone saying they have no respect for the election process.   I'm not that good of it myself.   What I don't understand is that person RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.  

""So,  tell us why you want to work here. ""

"" Well,  you're truly awful and I have nothing but disdain for your and your business. """
104,4,"I'd be one thing if he actually rationally criticized our process.

You know, the lack of a national voting holiday, low voter turnout when compared with western liberal democracies, corporate money in the process (inb4 ""but shillary,"" one candidate took the stage and pledged to appoint justices to overturn citizens united, and it wasn't trump), our failure to educate young Americans on civic responsibility, foreign governments actively attempting to subvert our process (*cough* Russia *cough*), totally inadequate polling stations in urban areas, etc, etc, etc.

But that's not what he does. When he's ahead, the polls are great, the people are great, the process is great. When he's down? Literally everything is rigged ooooo woe is me.

Jesus fuck how can you call yourself a trump supporter and not be embarrassed at this point?"
105,0,Van Jones has been AMAZING throughout all this. Always love what I hear from him.
106,4,"I know he’s from Fox News, but damn, I actually think Chris Wallace was a terrific moderator. He wasn’t afraid to interject the candidates when needed or when they didn’t address the question. While he did come across with a conservative bias once or twice, but he certainly stood up against Donald when it was needed. I would love to see him on another network."
107,0,I couldn't agree more. He was a great moderator. 
108,3,He killed it. He went after Clinton and Trump equally it felt like 
109,0,"Not only that, but he went after the audience. He was not putting up with any shit in his house."
110,0,"""Yeah!!!"" ""Woohoo!!!""

*""HEY SETTLE THE FUCK DOWN""*"
111,4,I will TURN THIS DEBATE AROUND so help me GOD
112,0,I was worried he'd be partisan but he seemed to have injected an anti-bullshit aura into the room.
113,0,Easy to do when he hates both candidates.
114,0,"Clearly this is the way it should be done, then."
115,0,"He was even tough on the audience for reacting. 

Chris Wallace just got a new fan. I respect his fairness. "
116,4,"Agreed, I think he was the best out of the three debates.  He kept it focused, kept the questions coming, and was respectful."
117,2,"Michelle Obama: ""When they go low, we go high"" 

Trump 2016: ""we can go lower"" "
118,4,Donald Trump had 60 seconds to let the people of America know why they should be voting him for president. He wasted those 60 seconds on trying to make Hillary look bad one last time. He should have just focused on himself for those last 60 seconds it looked extremely desperate and unprofessional in my opinion.
119,4,"And capped it with ""She's going to be four more years of that president who's more popular than ever right now."" Not showing the best judgement there."
120,2,Agreed. She was struggling in some of those later segments but then completely pulled it back together with that final answer. Then Trump took the easy opening and faceplanted to finish it off
121,4,"Steve Schmidt (R) calls Trump's refusal to accept the election result, under direct question, a ""disqualifying moment"" and calls on Paul Ryan to pull away."
122,2,If I get a nickel every time Trump has a disqualifying moment.....
123,0,You would have a small loan of a million dollars
124,2,"In case you need anymore proof that Hillary knows what she's doing, Hillary turn that Wikileake question around  to make it about Russia/Putin and Trump took the bait."
125,3,"I bet she's just laughing her ass off like ""I can't believe that worked.."""
126,3,"I loved that even while he called it out as being a pivot, which it was, he then continued to sound like a Putin evangelical by saying things like ""I haven't even met him! But they're so great! And we're so weak now! I think if we were friends everything would be better! Haven't met him but he's so strong!""

Was just a seriously jaw-droppingly bad performance. I thought maybe he could pick up more of the ignorant vote since he performed slightly better the second time and actually prepared this time, but just every time he talked it was rambling nonsense. Hillary said ""let me try to translate that"" and he would say ""you can't"" and it was true, because it was gibberish. This election has been entertaining as hell but good god is it going to be a landslide."
127,2,Fox News is surprisingly killing Trump's people on their lies.
128,4,Megyn Kelly is the winner of this debate holy shit.
129,4,"Why do you wanna be president? 

Clinton: this this and this. 

Trump: fuck clinton . Nasty woman"
130,0,"Honestly that's why all of his supporters are voting, so I'd say he hit the nail on the head...just happened to also seal his coffin hopefully. "
131,2,"Barack Obama's approval rating has recently reached a record high, and Trump just said on national TV that a Hillary Clinton presidency would be four more years of Obama.

Top-notch campaigning. 

Edit: spelling"
132,1,Its like Ryan invoking Bernie Sanders.
133,0,"yeah, there's no way that was an accident"
134,4,"So we could have tacos, a Sanders win, and 4 more years of Obama. We will find Utopia."
135,0,"Said this in the other thread, but: I didn't know one senator could change everything in government. He really needs to give up that talking point up.

I know what he is getting at, but it just doesn't make sense. Government in this country is based on compromise. Does he not understand that? "
136,4,"He kept repeating that she could have done something for 30 years, ok let's look at this. 

First Lady of Arkansas 
1983-1992
What can she do?

First Lady of the United States
1993-2001
What can she do?

United States Senator from New York
2001-2009
She worked with fellow members of the United States Senate to make some change but she has no ability to act unilaterally.

United States Secretary of State
2009-2013
Under direct command from Barack Obama but has some major power to enact change on a Geopolitical level.

So she had no real power until she became a U.S. Senator in 2001 which halves Trump's claim. On a global stage she only had real power for four years while being under the command of the POTUS. "
137,3,"No, he doesn't. When you listen to him speak he thinks he can run the country like he runs a company, but he can't."
138,0,Yeah I'm really surprised she didn't tell him that Senators can't introduce legislation that increases revenues because those bills must start in the House and the United States isn't a fucking dictatorship 
139,4,3 debates and not once did somebody get Donald to say **HOW** he was going to do something.
140,0,[deleted]
141,4,hes gonna do a lot of deals in the boardroom. negotiate some of the best deals youve ever seen. believe me. the best.
142,0,They're gonna be tremendous and bring millions and millions of jobs back to America. It's gonna be beautiful. Believe me. 
143,0,Other than his cuttting taxes lol.  It is the only thing he said about any of his plans.
144,0,And getting rid of Obamacare because apparently it's the root of all evil to him
145,4,"I think he just hates the word Obama, he will rename it to Trumpcare.

Who am I kidding, there won't be no care anymore."
146,0,He said it plenty of times.  Lower taxes.  That's all you gotta do!  The economy just fixes itself when you lower taxes.
147,4,"I think there are two categories of people right now:

1. People who have realized that it's a pointless question to ask because Trump doesn't have an answer.  
2. People who think it's a pointless question to ask because they don't care about the details but believe him when he says he'll do it.

I have a hard time believing that *anyone* who isn't already decided on voting for him still thinks he might actually be able to explain in detail what he plans to do.  It's shockingly blatant that there really isn't a concrete plan, just talking points."
148,3,"Just like last debate, Trump showed he has no idea how senate works, when he accused Hillary of not changing the laws on her own as a lone senator just like that."
149,0,"I keep wondering why she didn't remind him that she was a senator, not a dictator."
150,4,"> I keep wondering why she didn't remind him that she was a senator, not a dictator.

And she was only senator for 12 years, not 30.   30 years ago Hillary Clinton the First Lady of Arkansas.    She was supposed to have a major impact on the country from that position?  Have any other First Ladies of Arkansas affected our lives in any way?"
151,4,"Because it has to play in subtext.  Running for president, you can't project powerlessness even if it makes perfect sense.  The expectation is that a person running for president should have been corralling the senate themselves by putting forward, championing, and ensuring a vote for legislation.  To a point that's a totally reasonable expectation: senators can be very influential and we do want the best of the best for the highest office, but even when it isn't reasonable you can't say it.  Even a voter who understands the complexities can have their opinions colored by the implication of weakness."
152,4,"People understand, specially in the recent years, one person can't just change a law...  it's only Trump that doesn't seem to realize that....

Edit: can to can't 
"
153,4,Is Trump not getting his third Emmy basically his version of Hitler not getting into art school?
154,2,"On mobile so I don't have the link, but look up the vid of Obama trashing Trump at the presidential correspondents dinner a few years back. He gets him hard. They show Trump's reaction for a bit and it's just.. this look. That moment right there is like watching a supervillain being born.

It was also, coincidentally, the same night that (not yet known to the crowd/public) the raid on Bin Laden's compound was taking place."
155,0,This is my favorite post in the thread.  
156,0,Slow clap.
157,0,Suspenseful clap. 
158,4,"Not that it matteres but for anyone keeping notice Clinton wore a blue dress, a red dress, and tonight a white dress to complete her murica trinity. "
159,0,They were suits but yes. 
160,0,"I'm not normally into outfit talk, but I love that. Classy af"
161,4,"Huh, weird I didn't consciously notice that. The way I saw it was that she wore red the first debate to counter any idea of her being weak, she wore blue the second debate to paint her in a more calming and personable light, and she wore white the last debate to symbolize the purity of the office of the POTUS."

163,2,"Really thought that Clinton would just ride out the last debate and let Trump bury himself, but she actually went on the offensive and did it surprisingly well. She got the shots in while discussing policy and even added a bit of humor to the mix.

Trump got baited so badly when she did as well. He fell apart 90% of the times she insulted him. His whole debate went off the rails as soon as she said he had choked when he went to meet the president of Mexico.

Edit: Also Clinton looked genuinely disgusted by Trump at various times during the debate, and disgusted to be on the same stage as him. This election has been disturbingly personal at a level I don't remember seeing in any election before."

208,4,"He had way better control, but some of the framing of his questions were weird."
209,2,"I think his framing was very much from a Conservative/GOP/Fox News sort of angle, which isn't a huge shock considering where he works.

I liked it a bit though, because I thought it cut to a lot of issues that GOP/Conservative voters have with Hillary and Trump, and while it should've helped Trump by being more in his supposed 'sweet spot', it was such an incoherent, rambling mess most the time, it completely eliminated the advantage.  Conversely, it gave Clinton an opportunity to really face the 'tough' questions and hammer home solid answers (though she certainly pivoted from a few questions I think we all would've liked some more direct answers to).

In total, I think the debate was a microcosm of what (some of) Fox News and mainstream conservatives feel about Trump and the election - they don't like Clinton, but they know Trump is an asshat and a terrible choice.  I thought Wallace did a service by giving questions that allowed Clinton to really speak directly to the fears of moderate conservatives, and really make her case as being a perfectly acceptable and reasonable candidate for President - not this crazy boogie man that the alt-right and hardliners have...trumped...her up to be. "

This decision to terminate in my pregnancy later in process (due to t13) was not easy it down right sucked and it to this day, years later, kills me. 
I'll never get over it. 
Tonight I had to listen to someone talk about how I made my decision, how I had been cavalier about what I literally had to do due to the fact that quality of life for my daughter was basically null. 
To think I may have to live in a society where I would have to carry to full term knowing full well what was ahead of me, and not being able to humanly take care of myself and my child makes me question the ""greatness"" that our country is trying to strive to. "

228,4,"Trump's word choice during the pro-choice part was disgusting. 

""Rip the baby out"". 

It was scare rhetoric that neglected the sensitivities required of such a situation as late-term abortion. It showed an insensitivity to those women who would be placed in that position and how it is a very difficult situation. He just cannot empathize. Disgusting.  "
229,0,"The only person I knew that had a late term abortion (six months) did it because she found the  very wanted fetus had total anencephaly...and she couldn't bear the thought of having to deliver that baby and watch it suffer and die slowly.

Women don't do them for funsies. Jesus."
230,0,Same. It was heartbreaking. They'd been trying for years.
231,3,"Exactly. Also he acts like every woman who has a late term abortion wants to carry to full term, go through all the sickness and hardships on their body for as long as possible then get an abortion for the sake of it. He has no clue what he's talking about."
232,0,"Fuck him fuck him fuck him. A very good friend of mine had a late-term abortion because the babies neck had a hole in it, there were deformities with the head, and a whole host of issues. They told her if she carried to term and the baby survived, it would be suffering until it inevitably died. There was no way it would live beyond a few months, and they would have it in the hospital the entire time forcing the poor child to live. She chose not to hurt her baby that way. So I pray she was not watching this because fuck him for hurting people who have to go through that suffering with his words."

244,4,"I agree with Hillary - I am appalled that Trump refuses to say whether he will accept the outcome of the election.

If he wants to complain about biased media coverage, fine. If he wants to call attention to flaws in our voting system, fair play. But to recklessly question the core mechanism of our democracy, the only reason any of us believe it works, is irresponsible. It's irresponsible because it could inspire some very stupid, very impressionable, very dangerous people to feel as if their nation has been compromised and that they need to take action. We've already seen what those sick bastards in Kansas were planning; what's going to happen if their Dear Leader tells them that the election is illegitimate and the president elect has assumed power under false pretenses?

I've been shitposting along with most of r/politics in an effort to find some humor in this shitshow of an election, but this time I feel compelled to be completely serious. Shame on you, Donald Trump. We can now definitively confirm that there is truly no depths to which you won't descend.

351,4,"I thought the ""made of Chinese steel"" line was pretty good."
352,3,Yeah that was a genuine moment that reflected how a lot of us rational people feel when we hear shit like trump buying a giant portrait of himself with charity funds. 
353,1,"And when she talked about the photo of the injured Syrian child. It looked like a flash of anger, almost."

361,4,"Hillary won this one easily. Trump made so many odd comments, but saying he will keep us in suspense with if he will accept the results of the election? What the fuck?

364,3,"Him not accepting the result of the election is honestly fucking terrifying. Like, violence inducing to some of his supporters."
365,2,"To me the closing statement section really summed up the election. Whether she means to act on her promises or not, Hillary really acted like a leader and gave a message of inclusion and unity. Trump started his statement with an attack, then continued to fear monger and advocate more division in our society. As an undecided voter, I think this debate settled my indecision.

Also shoutout to Chris Wallace. Very professional moderator who was able to keep reasonable control over the debate and who tried his best to focus on real campaign issues. 

*Edit: I should clarify that I was undecided in the sense that I hadn't made my final decision until tonight. I've leaned away from Trump for a while now, but I tried to keep an open mind, especially because there are issues I don't agree with Hillary on. I decided to wait it out and pass my final judgement once the debates were over."

 Shift all blame onto current ruling power? Check. 

Develop hatred towards a scapegoat minority? Check. 

Develop a cult of personality, and claim to be the only possible savior to the people's problems? Check.

Call political system into question to lend legitimacy to insurrection and government takeover? Check.

Good thing he's such an asshat. If he were extremely likeable, attractive, and well spoken, this year could have been the death of democracy in America."

I can't even imagine what anyone could think could stop Hillary from winning now.

398,2,"The thing I find the most disconcerting, is the lack of accountability that Donald has shown throughout these debates. He has consistently shown that he will not take responsibility for any of his statements, even when they have the potential to incite violence--in regards to his cries of voter fraud.

His rhetoric is dangerous. Words have power, and as much as people hate the it, Donald Trump has significant support amongst a good percentage of voters. This incendiary rhetoric cannot be tolerated as it undermines the foundations of our democracy.

All I can say is that I hope the American people saw the enormous disparities between the two candidates tonight. Just as in the two previous presidential debates beforehand, it is clear that these two candidates have not only two very different ideas of American progress, but two very different realities.

While Hillary Clinton has had trouble with her public image and appearing transparent, she is undoubtedly the only candidate with policy positions founded upon empirical research, and that is fit to lead this nation.

I have faith that the American public will make the right decision."

Trump looked like he was 5 and someone took his candy.

400,2,"I was honestly a little nervous for the first 10 minutes.  Trump was doing alright, mostly sticking to his talking points, responding to questions, and not flying off the handle.  The bar has been set so low for him that if he kept that up he would have been seen as the winner.  Then he reverted to his usual self and melted down."

418,4,"Trump really outdid himself of this one... instant classic

>TRUMP: But I'd like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I'm -- not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries. Saudi Arabia, nothing but money. We protect Saudi Arabia. Why aren't they paying?   She immediately -- when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO. Why aren't the NATO questioned -- why aren't they paying? Because they weren't paying. Since I did this -- this was a year ago -- all of a sudden, they're paying. And I've been given a lot -- a lot of credit for it. All of a sudden, they're starting to pay up. They have to pay up. We're protecting people, they have to pay up. And I'm a big fan of NATO. But they have to pay up. She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great. Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.  We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out. We have, during his regime, during President Obama's regime, we've doubled our national debt. We're up to $20 trillion.

>So my plan -- we're going to renegotiate trade deals. We're going to have a lot of free trade. We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now. But we have horrible deals. Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever. Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy. You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them. You go upstate New York. Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places. We're bringing our jobs back. I am going to renegotiate NAFTA. And if I can't make a great deal -- then we're going to terminate NAFTA and we're going to create new deals. We're going to have trade, but we're going -- we're going to terminate it, we're going to make a great trade deal. And if we can't, we're going to do it -- we're going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster. We are going to cut taxes massively. We're going to cut business taxes massively. They're going to start hiring people. We're going to bring the $2.5 trillion ...that's offshore back into the country. We are going to start the engine rolling again, because... right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP.

At worst she will do nothing, but for Trump, at worst he will damage this country.

He was pressing Clinton on the appearance of a conflict of interest with her Foundation, and her answer was not the best.

527,3,"Half of me is mad she didn't answer the question, but the other half of me applauded the fact that she was smart enough to recognize Donald's interruption as an easy way to get out of the corner she was in. Like her or not, girl's got mad debate skills."
528,3,"I'm honestly a little disappointed in all these debates. Clinton's biggest strength as a politician who is a major policy hawk, well read on every issue to an insane level, who usually doesn't give the time of day to anything else. Her main problem is that she doesn't really care about stuff like using private email servers, and she has had to study a lot on how to do the traditional bloviating politician shtick.

If the Republicans had actually nominated a semi-serious candidate, we would probably be having some very sharp and revealing policy discussion where Clinton and this imaginary Republican go toe to toe on where economic growth comes from, how to untangle Syria, and what can be done to improve race relations. We would here about body cameras, carbon caps, and entitlement reform like they were nothing.

Instead, we get this shit. Clinton is one of the smartest people out there and will be a much better President than she is a campaigner. If the GOP thinks they will have an easy time in 2020 they are in for a surprise."

The way tax brackets work is e.g. : every dollar you earn 1-9.99MM is taxed at 35% every dollar after 10MM in that year is taxed at 90%. This is just an example but I wanna stress because lots get this wrong, at no time does making more money and getting taxed more mean that you make less net money."

554,4,"The hillaryclinton.com shoutouts bothered me too, they didn't really appeal to an independent audience. Saying to just google it is much, much more effective.

555,3,"I don't understand how you can run for president and not realize when you have a microphone attached to you people can replay what you said. Like when he denied making fun of the disabled reporter. 

His surrogates tried to play it off that it was OK he did it because he also made fun of other people. 

But he still denies he did it. Like I can't just YouTube the clip. "

What does it *mean*?"
576,4,"In the history of our nation, each losing candidate makes a concession speech. Every. Single. One. The moderator pretty much laid out the grounds, it is accepted as the norm - almost an unwritten rule if you will - and we move on as a nation. 

**Edit:** The moderator, not Clinton, pointed out that it is essentially custom.

Wallace: But sir, there's a tradition in this country of the peaceful transition of power, and no matter how hard fought a campaign is, the loser concedes to the winner - not saying you'll be the loser - and they come together for the good of the country."
577,2,Trump is very good with unwritten rules........*Tax returns* *cough cough*....uh *sniff*
578,4,"It means he can't answer yes or no, because if he wins, he'll accept the outcome.  If he loses, he's going to whine like a petulant child and declare it's a rigged outcome and The People shouldn't accept that Clinton won.  

From his POV, it's a trick question.  He can't say, ""I accept the outcome no matter what"" or ""I won't accept the outcome"", because it depends on who wins.  If Clinton wins, then it wasn't a real, legitimate election and the voters didn't really get their voice heard.  If he wins, then it's the will of the people and there's no sense challenging his victory."

585,0,"Honestly Van's best quote of the night was when he was discussing Hombres post debate. The female Hispanic pundant said she found it offensive and why, and the conservative pendants tore into about political correctness being bad.

Van sat there and said something along the lines of: If I tell you something is offensive, and you tell me, it is in the nature of civility that I try to understand how what I said was wrong. It used to be called civility. It wasn't called ""political correctness"" until others(hinting to minorities) started asking for it.

An absolutely perfect and succinct way to sum up the point. "

But that's not what he does. When he's ahead, the polls are great, the people are great, the process is great. When he's down? Literally everything is rigged ooooo woe is me.

600,2,Agreed. She was struggling in some of those later segments but then completely pulled it back together with that final answer. Then Trump took the easy opening and faceplanted to finish it off

But they're so great! And we're so weak now! I think if we were friends everything would be better! Haven't met him but he's so strong!""

Was just a seriously jaw-droppingly bad performance. I thought maybe he could pick up more of the ignorant vote since he performed slightly better the second time and actually prepared this time, but just every time he talked it was rambling nonsense. Hillary said ""let me try to translate that"" and he would say ""you can't"" and it was true, because it was gibberish.

What can she do?

First Lady of the United States
1993-2001
What can she do?

United States Senator from New York
2001-2009
She worked with fellow members of the United States Senate to make some change but she has no ability to act unilaterally.

United States Secretary of State
2009-2013
Under direct command from Barack Obama but has some major power to enact change on a Geopolitical level.

So she had no real power until she became a U.S. Senator in 2001 which halves Trump's claim. On a global stage she only had real power for four years while being under the command of the POTUS. "

2. People who think it's a pointless question to ask because they don't care about the details but believe him when he says he'll do it.

I have a hard time believing that *anyone* who isn't already decided on voting for him still thinks he might actually be able to explain in detail what he plans to do.  It's shockingly blatant that there really isn't a concrete plan, just talking points."

622,4,"> I keep wondering why she didn't remind him that she was a senator, not a dictator.

And she was only senator for 12 years, not 30.   30 years ago Hillary Clinton the First Lady of Arkansas.    She was supposed to have a major impact on the country from that position?  Have any other First Ladies of Arkansas affected our lives in any way?"
623,4,"Because it has to play in subtext.  Running for president, you can't project powerlessness even if it makes perfect sense.  The expectation is that a person running for president should have been corralling the senate themselves by putting forward, championing, and ensuring a vote for legislation.  To a point that's a totally reasonable expectation: senators can be very influential and we do want the best of the best for the highest office, but even when it isn't reasonable you can't say it.  Even a voter who understands the complexities can have their opinions colored by the implication of weakness."

I liked it a bit though, because I thought it cut to a lot of issues that GOP/Conservative voters have with Hillary and Trump, and while it should've helped Trump by being more in his supposed 'sweet spot', it was such an incoherent, rambling mess most the time, it completely eliminated the advantage.  Conversely, it gave Clinton an opportunity to really face the 'tough' questions and hammer home solid answers (though she certainly pivoted from a few questions I think we all would've liked some more direct answers to).

In total, I think the debate was a microcosm of what (some of) Fox News and mainstream conservatives feel about Trump and the election - they don't like Clinton, but they know Trump is an asshat and a terrible choice.  I thought Wallace did a service by giving questions that allowed Clinton to really speak directly to the fears of moderate conservatives, and really make her case as being a perfectly acceptable and reasonable candidate for President - not this crazy boogie man that the alt-right and hardliners have...trumped...her up to be.

There was no way it would live beyond a few months, and they would have it in the hospital the entire time forcing the poor child to live. She chose not to hurt her baby that way.

693,2,I think she also attacked Trump in the second debate for being a climate denier.

707,0,He must have had that put in just before coming out on stage.

Wallace: Well, no."
723,2,"Yes.  Clinton deliberately avoided taking about Trump in her closing, and it made her look much better."
724,0,"What rubbed me the wrong way is that he was framing it as ""I'll nominate people who are pro-gun and pro-life"" instead of saying that he would favor judicial nominations that would be strict Constitutionalists. It implies that he would prefer the court to be political, when that's the last thing it should be. Antonio Scalia was always accused of being Conservative, but he stuck by his judicial theory of strict interpretation, not by party lines alone."
725,0,I don't understand people who want the constitution to never change and be interpreted strictly to the text. It's not gospel and the founding fathers weren't prophets.
726,2,He literally admitted that he would rig the supreme court to agree with him and do what he wants. Trump has consistently demonstrated an incredible misunderstanding of the US' countermeasures and balances. This and his repeated adamance that Clinton should have been able to change everything singlehandedly

It was kind of amazing the way she just took him apart up there."

788,3,"I'm honestly a little disappointed in all these debates. Clinton's biggest strength as a politician who is a major policy hawk, well read on every issue to an insane level, who usually doesn't give the time of day to anything else. Her main problem is that she doesn't really care about stuff like using private email servers, and she has had to study a lot on how to do the traditional bloviating politician shtick.

If the Republicans had actually nominated a semi-serious candidate, we would probably be having some very sharp and revealing policy discussion where Clinton and this imaginary Republican go toe to toe on where economic growth comes from, how to untangle Syria, and what can be done to improve race relations. We would here about body cameras, carbon caps, and entitlement reform like they were nothing.

Instead, we get this shit. Clinton is one of the smartest people out there and will be a much better President than she is a campaigner. If the GOP thinks they will have an easy time in 2020 they are in for a surprise."
789,0,And when the highest tax bracket was 90%. These people are fucking stupid.
790,0,I love how they gloss over that so often.
791,0,"Wait, for real? 

I'm a filthy rube that actually doesn't know what the highest tax rate was in 1950."
792,0,"Yeah the highest bracket was super high up until Reagan slashed em. The way tax brackets work is e.g. : every dollar you earn 1-9.99MM is taxed at 35% every dollar after 10MM in that year is taxed at 90%. This is just an example but I wanna stress because lots get this wrong, at no time does making more money and getting taxed more mean that you make less net money."
793,0,"Australian here, lots of otherwise smart, normal people do not realise this. They complain about being pushed into a ""higher tax bracket"" as if it means they get less money."
794,4,"Jeffrey Lord was defending Trump's use of the term ""bad hombres"" and said he heard that on TV in the 50s all the time."
795,4,"He defended ""bad hombres"" as an inoffensive saying.  First, he said it's ""not as bad as the N word"".  Then, he followed that by saying that he hears people using it all the time.  When someone asked where he hears it, he cited ""1950s TV shows"". "

799,0,"My god, so glad she got rid of the Trumped up trickle down bullshit.  "
800,4,"The hillaryclinton.com shoutouts bothered me too, they didn't really appeal to an independent audience. Saying to just google it is much, much more effective.

If Hillary were half as nefarious as people love to suggest, she'd have SEO people working on the Trump results. With as tight a campaign she's been running, I wouldn't be surprised."
801,3,"I don't understand how you can run for president and not realize when you have a microphone attached to you people can replay what you said. Like when he denied making fun of the disabled reporter. 

His surrogates tried to play it off that it was OK he did it because he also made fun of other people. 

But he still denies he did it. Like I can't just YouTube the clip. "
802,3,Its like hillary had a previous job or two where she talked with world leaders all the time...
803,1,"Oh no, she was playing him like a fiddle. While I would have appreciated it if she had stood her ground more on a few things (what the hell is so awful about NAFTA specifically?) I feel like she effectively showed how much of a reactive punk Trump is."

812,4,"In the history of our nation, each losing candidate makes a concession speech. Every. Single. One. The moderator pretty much laid out the grounds, it is accepted as the norm - almost an unwritten rule if you will - and we move on as a nation. 

**Edit:** The moderator, not Clinton, pointed out that it is essentially custom.

Wallace: But sir, there's a tradition in this country of the peaceful transition of power, and no matter how hard fought a campaign is, the loser concedes to the winner - not saying you'll be the loser - and they come together for the good of the country."
813,2,Trump is very good with unwritten rules........*Tax returns* *cough cough*....uh *sniff*
814,4,"It means he can't answer yes or no, because if he wins, he'll accept the outcome.  If he loses, he's going to whine like a petulant child and declare it's a rigged outcome and The People shouldn't accept that Clinton won.  

From his POV, it's a trick question.  He can't say, ""I accept the outcome no matter what"" or ""I won't accept the outcome"", because it depends on who wins.  If Clinton wins, then it wasn't a real, legitimate election and the voters didn't really get their voice heard.  If he wins, then it's the will of the people and there's no sense challenging his victory."

818,0,Every single inaguration day it's celebrated how beautiful and important this is
819,0,It actually is. This is literally insurrection against the United States.  Accepting the peaceful transfer of power and election results is the foundation of our government. Take that away and we have nothing but chaos.
820,4,"I'd be one thing if he actually rationally criticized our process.

You know, the lack of a national voting holiday, low voter turnout when compared with western liberal democracies, corporate money in the process (inb4 ""but shillary,"" one candidate took the stage and pledged to appoint justices to overturn citizens united, and it wasn't trump), our failure to educate young Americans on civic responsibility, foreign governments actively attempting to subvert our process (*cough* Russia *cough*), totally inadequate polling stations in urban areas, etc, etc, etc.

But that's not what he does. When he's ahead, the polls are great, the people are great, the process is great. When he's down? Literally everything is rigged ooooo woe is me.

And she was only senator for 12 years, not 30.   30 years ago Hillary Clinton the First Lady of Arkansas.    She was supposed to have a major impact on the country from that position?  Have any other First Ladies of Arkansas affected our lives in any way?"
835,4,"Because it has to play in subtext.  Running for president, you can't project powerlessness even if it makes perfect sense.  The expectation is that a person running for president should have been corralling the senate themselves by putting forward, championing, and ensuring a vote for legislation.  To a point that's a totally reasonable expectation: senators can be very influential and we do want the best of the best for the highest office, but even when it isn't reasonable you can't say it.  Even a voter who understands the complexities can have their opinions colored by the implication of weakness."

"
855,4,"He had way better control, but some of the framing of his questions were weird."
856,2,"I think his framing was very much from a Conservative/GOP/Fox News sort of angle, which isn't a huge shock considering where he works.

I liked it a bit though, because I thought it cut to a lot of issues that GOP/Conservative voters have with Hillary and Trump, and while it should've helped Trump by being more in his supposed 'sweet spot', it was such an incoherent, rambling mess most the time, it completely eliminated the advantage.  Conversely, it gave Clinton an opportunity to really face the 'tough' questions and hammer home solid answers (though she certainly pivoted from a few questions I think we all would've liked some more direct answers to).

In total, I think the debate was a microcosm of what (some of) Fox News and mainstream conservatives feel about Trump and the election - they don't like Clinton, but they know Trump is an asshat and a terrible choice.  I thought Wallace did a service by giving questions that allowed Clinton to really speak directly to the fears of moderate conservatives, and really make her case as being a perfectly acceptable and reasonable candidate for President - not this crazy boogie man that the alt-right and hardliners have...trumped...her up to be.

896,0,"Hell, I haven't prepared for this election"
897,2,Hillary Clinton could legitimately run foreign policy better in a drunken stupor than Trump at his best.
898,0,"At one point he actually said they're all poor and uneducated. 

He also failed to mention that chicagoans get all their guns by driving 20 minutes into the next county.

899,0,Most guns involved in crime in Chicago originate in Indiana. If only Trumo knew the governor there!
900,0,^^^^^^wrong
901,3,"I'm honestly a little disappointed in all these debates. Clinton's biggest strength as a politician who is a major policy hawk, well read on every issue to an insane level, who usually doesn't give the time of day to anything else. Her main problem is that she doesn't really care about stuff like using private email servers, and she has had to study a lot on how to do the traditional bloviating politician shtick.

If the Republicans had actually nominated a semi-serious candidate, we would probably be having some very sharp and revealing policy discussion where Clinton and this imaginary Republican go toe to toe on where economic growth comes from, how to untangle Syria, and what can be done to improve race relations. We would here about body cameras, carbon caps, and entitlement reform like they were nothing.

Instead, we get this shit. Clinton is one of the smartest people out there and will be a much better President than she is a campaigner. If the GOP thinks they will have an easy time in 2020 they are in for a surprise."
902,0,I love how they gloss over that so often.
903,0,"Wait, for real? 

I'm a filthy rube that actually doesn't know what the highest tax rate was in 1950."
904,0,"Yeah the highest bracket was super high up until Reagan slashed em. The way tax brackets work is e.g. : every dollar you earn 1-9.99MM is taxed at 35% every dollar after 10MM in that year is taxed at 90%. This is just an example but I wanna stress because lots get this wrong, at no time does making more money and getting taxed more mean that you make less net money."
905,0,"Australian here, lots of otherwise smart, normal people do not realise this. They complain about being pushed into a ""higher tax bracket"" as if it means they get less money."
906,0,"My god, so glad she got rid of the Trumped up trickle down bullshit.  "
907,4,"*Right wingers are always superstitious, and the appearance of disastrous polling numbers for The Donald has caused panic among them. They are convinced that this is a sign that the end of times is near or that the election is rigged*

927,0,The third policy is Making America Great Again.
928,4,I think that's the point.

930,2,"I think his framing was very much from a Conservative/GOP/Fox News sort of angle, which isn't a huge shock considering where he works.

I liked it a bit though, because I thought it cut to a lot of issues that GOP/Conservative voters have with Hillary and Trump, and while it should've helped Trump by being more in his supposed 'sweet spot', it was such an incoherent, rambling mess most the time, it completely eliminated the advantage.  Conversely, it gave Clinton an opportunity to really face the 'tough' questions and hammer home solid answers (though she certainly pivoted from a few questions I think we all would've liked some more direct answers to).

In total, I think the debate was a microcosm of what (some of) Fox News and mainstream conservatives feel about Trump and the election - they don't like Clinton, but they know Trump is an asshat and a terrible choice.  I thought Wallace did a service by giving questions that allowed Clinton to really speak directly to the fears of moderate conservatives, and really make her case as being a perfectly acceptable and reasonable candidate for President - not this crazy boogie man that the alt-right and hardliners have...trumped...her up to be.
