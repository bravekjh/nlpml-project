14,"I will never understand how people can say some of the things being said 
throughout this election. No matter who you choose to vote for, it is not 
right to say any of the candidates should commit suicide or be murdered. It 
is also very silly to assume that World War III is going to breakout due to 
the results of this election, or that this country is headed towards the 
apocalypse. With that being said though, Donald Trump is the best candidate 
we could vote for, because otherwise, our country will be worse off. His 
only real competition is Hillary Clinton, who has proven herself to be a 
crooked and corrupt politician; any third-party candidate currently running 
for president stands no chance of actually winning. 


Donald Trump is nowhere near as bad as people think he is. Despite popular 
belief, he is not going to lead our country into an era of racism, sexism, 
xenophobia, or hate. Sure, he has said some pretty offensive things, but 
that just shows that he is an actual person who does not try to be 
politically correct in order to just win the vote. We have all said things 
that we regret or did not mean, and that makes us human. Politicians like 
Hillary Clinton have said things almost as bad as what Trump has said, but 
only in private. For example, as much as people like to point to out that 
Donald Trump has accused President Barack Obama of being born in Kenya, it 
was a Clinton employee who first suggested it. According to Joshua 
Muravchik in ‚ÄúHillary Clinton‚Äôs Bad Old Days‚Äù, ‚ÄúClinton-family retainer 
Sidney Blumenthal had furnished the material on Obama‚Äôs past‚Äù (34). Clinton 
is unreliable and has crooked ways, as she now claims to support Obama.


Hillary Clinton‚Äôs corruption as a politician is also demonstrated by the 
way that she can be ‚Äúbought‚Äù. Many people believe that she is nothing more 
than a puppet for large corporations and rich people that donate to her 
foundation. As Sam Frizell points out in ‚ÄúThe Benefits of Friendship with 
Hillary Clinton‚Äù, ‚Äúhalf the private individuals whom Clinton met with‚Ä¶ 
donated to the foundation. That‚Äôs 85 out of 154 people‚Äù (5). This 
contradicts a Clinton quote that Frizell also brings to attention, 
‚Äú‚ÄòDemocracy can't just be for billionaires‚Äô‚Äù (6). Donald Trump is a 
billionaire who worked throughout his life to get to this point, and will 
not be easily bought, as he is not hungry for the money. The same can not 
be said for Hillary. 


I understand why so many people are reluctant to give Donald Trump a 
chance. He‚Äôs a loudmouth who lacks political experience, but compared to 
Hillary, he is safe. He has proven that he understands the economy with the 
fact that he has done so well, and he has policies that could help our 
country. Many people may be put off by what Trump has said about some 
things, such as illegal immigrants, and his idea of ‚Äúbuilding a wall‚Äù to 
keep them from coming into the United States. Those people just 
misunderstand though, as Trump claims in his book Crippled America: How to 
Make America Great Again, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to stop legal immigration to this 
country. In fact, I would like to reform and increase immigration in some 
important ways‚Äù (29). I believe that many of his other policies may be 
misunderstood as well, but in time, if he becomes president, we will see 
that he has what is best for our country in mind. In regard to those voting 
for a third-party candidate, you are just wasting your vote. Your 
frustration with both major candidates is understandable, but please think 
about which of them will be better for our country, as you could be making 
a huge mistake by not voting for them. Donald Trump is not the only the 
most fit candidate for presidency, but perhaps the only fit candidate.",0.0308945563931,0.099538538792

1) People were so afraid of being rude and racist to others because they 
could get in trouble or hurt, but now since there is a popular racist rich 
guy, they can let everything out.

2) He owns a million dollar company. People think that with money he can do 
anything and it's true, he can bribe ANYONE into doing ANYTHING. 

3) He goes against all the stereotypes. Because of vines and websites, 
everyone has a specific thought on a person or race. Trump takes advantage 
of this and makes people hate and be afraid of these people. This helps him 
on his way to build a wall and deport millions of people. 

4) He only talks about immigrants and why Hillary is bad while Hillary 
talks about the countries status and future. But with all trump has said, 
he has made people hate Hillary.

Now the reasons why he would be. A bad president. I know Hillary has made 
mistakes and has lied and said some things, but trump has made WAY MORE 
than Hillary. 

Trump goes to Mexico, makes the president trust him, (lie), comes back and 
rants about Mexico, He said he loves Mexicans, (lie), wants to deport them, 
he says women are great and he respect them, (lie), He later goes on and 
insults them and has have been recorded with sexual assaults and racism.

If he deports people, the economy will go way down since even though many 
jobs will be open for Americans, there won't be enough to fill in the gap 
left from the millions of people that got deported. Farms will no longer be 
occupied by Mexicans and immigrants, and helpers of American farmers since 
no one will want to do those jobs causing a major depletion of food. And 
since he will stop importing things from many countries including food, 
causing more food depletion. 

Also other countries will become over populated and will cause major 
problems with increased food production needed and with many buildings left 
in America after people abandoned them, there will be thousands of acres 
worth of land wasted.




Think of the future. You hold the fate of America and the world in your 
hands. Become a hero. Choose what is right. Vote for Hillary. 




#DumpTrump #HillaryForPresident",0.0499514337563,0.187729451484
59,"‚ÄúDonald Trump is running for president.‚Äù I think we all had the same 
reaction when we heard this news but now we probably have some different 
views. Although we may disagree on many things I believe one thing we can 
agree on is that these are two of the worst candidates we‚Äôve ever had in 
American history. 
I was 100% anti-Trump when he proposed his candidacy, but through following 
the election he seems to be the best option we have in 2016. Though he has 
said some extremely radical things, such as building a wall to keep illegal 
immigrants from coming across the border, that is not a bad idea. He is not 
saying he wants to deport ALL immigrants. Trump is just enforcing a law 
because it is in fact illegal to be in America ILLEGALLY.
‚ÄúThe current official unemployment rate for Hispanics is 9.1 percent, 
compared to 7.6 percent for the nation as a whole.‚Äù It is understandable 
for Donald Trump to be upset with these numbers because they are increasing 
our country as a whole‚Äôs numbers. Hispanic voters are mostly against the 
republican party but there are ‚Äúnew forces‚Äù who are fighting for 
immigration reform and fair treatment for Latinos. 46% of voters in a poll 
agree with this statement. Some people say this is morally wrong but if you 
look back to the Sedition Act of 1798 the federalists discouraged low life 
immigrants and wanted to grant president the right to deport the unwanted. 
With that being said these views are not a new idea to a person of 
political importance. 
CNN has caught Trump in some bad situation. Such as an audio recording 
where Trump speaks of his daughter‚Äôs breasts, three-way sex, and him not 
dating women older than 35. Also, caught on the recording was talk of him 
‚Äúbarging‚Äù into beauty pageant dressing rooms. Trumps running mate, Mike 
Pence, says he is ‚Äúdistraught about all of Trumps doings.‚Äù Although this 
may be true his disrespect does not even amount to the torture and acts of 
malice toward women by Isis. Trump will still provide women with the same 
opportunities as others in a professional manner.",0.251614104236,-0.0733513514176

88,"I think, its a very easy decision.
You have the choice between Trump, an unscrupulous Businessman and Clinton, 
a woman that did some very poor decisions during her life; but she is the 
only chance for America. Obama did something wrong, like any other 
president too, cause nobody's perfect, but he did steps into the right 
direction and Clinton can expand this. America is stronger together, 
America dont need someone who is trying to divide its people into Muslims, 
Hispanics and Americans. In my country, guns are prohibited and it works 
very well. We dont have a shoot-out in a public school every two months and 
that high amount of firearm deaths. Trump wants to keep his Citizens safe 
and create prosperity but he denies the gunfact. Clinton however tries like 
Obama too, to decrease the amount of weapons. In fact, if you elect Trump 
for the next 4 years, you have to life with the consequences, and not just 
you, the whole world has to deal with this decision. So, do yourself and 
the world a favor and vote for Clinton. Reality has no rewind

89,"I am only 12 years old and this is my only off day and I'm spending my time 
looking at the presidential debate because I really want to understand 
what's going around in my world. people that vote for Donald Trump are just 
looking about how much money he has and I just probably bribed in some way 
, but Hillary Clinton will be the perfect person for the job. I don't know 
much about the presidential debate because I am so long but from what I 
hear I think Hillary Clinton is the best person for the job because she 
gets her point across and she's very thorough about how she will make 
America great again. people like Donald Trump are business owners and all 
they care about is money now I'm not saying that Donald Trump is in a good 
person in that doesn't his point across but he doesn't really focus on the 
topic.Now you can look at both sides Donald Trump wants to make it legal 
for anyone to be able to have a gun and he wants to build a wall to reduce 
the amount of immigration. Hillary Clinton wants back background checks on 
people when they are trying to purchase a gun for our safety as well as for 
kids and she wants to reduce the amount of poverty in America by making 
things more affordable especially when it comes to people that are able to 
afford for their children to go to college. I understand why Donald Trump 
is coming from when he wants to keep out people that will harm us but it 
still doesn't mean that people that have been here for hundreds and 
hundreds of years they should just go back to somewhere that wasn't either 
comfortable or a good position for their families. Hillary Clinton wants us 
all to be equal. the presidential debate is really confusing for someone my 
age but the only things that I take out of it is that Hillary Clinton will 
provide safety and money for people in need and for children. Hillary 
Clinton is not selfish and cares about others before thinking about 
herself. #Hillary Clinton 2016",-0.0204106964206,0.164297871495

State being more corrupt than any person to ever run for the Office of 
President Of The United States, it is and was inevitable that someone 
other than established politicians would run. It was also inevitable 
that they would win. Why you may ask? Or not. Because more and more 
citizens of this country have become disgusted with the way The United 
States is going. Progressives, eie the party of Woodrow Wilson, FDR, 
Truman ect did not and do not believe in the Constitution and Bill of 
Rights as a living and just as important document as it was in the 
founding of our country. Little by little, because we do not pay 
attention, we are having our freedoms taken from us. Our short attention
spans will be the destruction of our country as we have known it in the
past. Progressive thought is that the government not only should but 
has the right to involve itself in our live by taking responsibility for
things the Constitution and the Bill of Rights did not give it 
permission and in some cases out right forbid it to do or take. What we 
saw happen in this election is a direct response to a government out of 
control. Americans are waking up. It had to happen sooner or later and 
sooner is best. It is people like Sarah Trachtenburg that think that 
electing a 
person like Clinton is ok even if she is corrupt, a traitor, a betrayer 
of employees of her own department, Benghazi, even if she furthers her 
and Bill's own fortunes off of the relief funds headed to victims of 
terrible events in this world. Even if she has no care for slain 
Americans and can go before Congress and say, and I quote, ""What 
difference does it make."" And even if she can lie through her teeth and 
everyone knows she is lying through her teeth. Have you ever wondered 
why many people who have crossed her are no longer heard from or around?

than the other Republican nominees?
Voters have said that Trump talks just the way they do. That's because 
Trump's not a politician just like most of the voters aren't. They don't 
know things work in office. And if Trump becomes president, he's going to 
find out the hard way how things work and is going to realize, very 
quickly, that he's in over his head and that running for president was a 
huge mistake. If Trump realizes that he's in over his head, he's not going 
to resign even if he's advised to because he'll tell his advisors, ""No, if 
I resign then everyone is going to know that I couldn't do this job and if

265,"Leader Trump

When the word, ‚Äúleader‚Äù, goes through your mind, do you think of a man or 
woman? Obviously, a woman can be just as or even more manly than a man can 
be. But image is very important to our enemies way of thinking which leads 
to their decisions. Trump is only going to do good things to our military 
and create a GREATLY, assertive image upon our threats. Security is a 
beautiful thing and will keep so much stress away from our minds.

With being president comes great power and with great power, Trump knows 
good and well about great responsibility. Donald Trump seems to have a good 
perspective of responsibility. He has already proven how responsible he is 
with his decision making as a business man. Just from impressions, it might 
seem that he makes risky decisions but within the past decades he hasn‚Äôt 
showed us anything but success and extreme productivity. Trump may be 
drastically different, but that also means that he is an ,outside of the 
box, thinker, for example, ‚ÄúHe tends to buy properties that have less of an 
upside if they also are a safer choice (i.e., less downside).‚Äù.

America‚Äôs debt simply and literally needs conservation because of all of 
our investments being made in the last 2 terms. Trump is only bringing 
notice to the most effective problems that don't try to focus on as many 
people‚Äôs feelings as possible. He will not make ignorant decisions because 
he has gained more than he has lost from bankruptcy and gained an unlimited 
amount of resources to make him all around successful. Donald Trump has 
proven that he is active and willing to put in work because of his rapid 
amount of trial and error.

Every penny counts as Donald Trump just wants to save/make money along with 
growing our economy more efficiently than ever before. He has a plan to 
reduce most taxes. Trump is tremendously serious about calculations to set 
his goals higher than most people are ready for. Because of most people 
thinking that taxes are inevitable, they just assume that we will lose so 
much money if we cut them but if Trump becomes president I strongly believe 
that money will be one of the least of our worries.

Currently, among our peers and media, we see how Trump supporters just do 
not ‚Äúfit in‚Äù. All the youngins these days just won‚Äôt open their mind up a 
little because they never imagined him and his different ideologies 
proceeding in politics. Our fairly new generations don‚Äôt understand how 
Trump is the actual republican candidate. Our media has convinced so many 
people that Trump is the most unsophisticated choice, therefore, they also 
want to convince more people to not vote for Trump. This, of course, leads 
to making many republicans feel that Trump just can‚Äôt be an option because 
of the pressure other peers have put on them.",0.384456494935,-0.0692790356924

years, and now their grandparents can't even come and visit us, not even my 
uncle! My parents will end up being deported leaving me, my sister and my 
pet helpless with no food, water, or money. I may very likely be spending 
my time living in my school. That's not all, over 5,000,000 kids will be 
left alone with no one to help them. Even if we do get help, we will still 
be separated from our loving parents. And over 300 people have said that 
they will commit suicide if trump wins. Not to mention the other deaths 
caused by homeless children and innocent immigrants who have lost 
everything they have worked for. My mom has worked for Allstate for 13 
years and has recently opened up her own agency with Allstate after 4 years 
of school, traveling, and work. My dad has helped many Americans with work 
and projects as well not criticize anyone even if they are racist, 
American, or African American. My mom tries to save lives and supports many 
organizations and has donated thousands of dollars to programs trying to 
save lives.Also think about it, Abraham Lincoln tried his best to keep this 
country together but got killed for his efforts.Martin Luther King Jr. not 
only helped fight for equal rights for African Americans, but Mexicans, 
Hispanics, Muslims, women, and other immigrants who were struggling getting 
a better life.Do you really want a president who is a racist jerk who only 
cares about his own personal gain? I do agree that there are some bad 
people that do some bad crimes, but you don't see trump putting all the 
American criminals and serial killers in jail! Choose what is right. The 
fate of America and millions of lives rests in your hands. You can be a 
hero or a villain. You hold the power. Choose what's right.

429,"Dear Hillary Supporters,
I'm 28 years old. Never voted in my life before this election. Why? I 
always felt that the candidates running were always similar to the ones 
running previously. Nothing ever stood out to me. Until this election.

Donald Trump absolutely has his flaws. Not wording things the right way, 
gets angry quick, acts childish, doesn't sound politically correct 
etc......... but i want you to watch him and take a good look at him in the 
past few months. Watch his demeanor. This is a man who doesn't need this 
position. A billionaire who can retire and live a very pleasant life. He 
spent over 100 million dollars so far, has been ridiculed and scorn by the 
media and still has the energy to attend 7 rallies in a day. Let me say 
that again SEVEN RALLIES IN A DAY!

Instead of piggybacking with the media and the celebrities, take a real 
good look at this mans work ethic. Look into his eyes and see the sincerity 
in them. Take a look at his family. My father once told me you can tell a 
lot about a man from his family. His family is respectful, they know that 
hard work brings great things and they know that together they are stronger.

Vote for Hillary if you want, but in the end all you will get with her is 
the same damn thing you got with Obama. Just another politician.

Take a chance with Donald J. Trump. Be unique in a room full of followers. 
Who cares if Lady Gaga or Bon Jovi Or Jay Z backs her for God knows 
whatever reason. Be unique and stand up for what you truly believe in. I 
guarantee, what you believe in, is what Trump wants to make happen in this 
great country we call America.

God Bless You & GET OUT AND VOTE!",-0.0215073708562,-0.00926190017276

picking the candidate which represents the ""lesser"" evil. Really? Why would 
we want to vote for evil at all? This debate rages, all the while we ignore 
the bigger evil/elephant in the room. We have brought this situation upon 
ourselves. Our Constitution begins with ""We the People.."" not They the 
Politicians. The current state of affairs, or the lack of a good political 
candidate is not the fault of any political party it is the fault of We the 
People. We have become lazy and complacent. We don't want to have to work 
to solve our problems we would rather give them to someone else along with 
the power and authority. We are so complacent in letting others take care 
of things we are even willing to give up our rights as guaranteed in the 
Constitution itself. We have turned Washington from a garden of democracy 
to a cesspool of decadence. America worked because We the People, as a 
whole, stood for something. We always took the higher road. You can't 
legislate morality, it must come from the society. A society that works and 
cares for its individuals. We no longer want to work for what we get 
material or otherwise, we want it handed to us. This sense of entitlement 
is destroying the fundamental principles used to build this country. We 
don't want to face problems in our communities, we want someone else to do 
that. We are even willing to let the state raise our children. It's time to 
wake up! We are the problem. We have become sheep. Why do we allow politics 
to become a career? Why don't we hold our representatives to the same 
higher moral code we want to tread? Why do we let the media tell us what is 
and is not correct? We the People should set the standards, We the People 
should wake up and start caring about our neighbors, our communities and 
our country. The Constitution of the United States is a divinely inspired 
document which paved the way for not only one great nation, but many which 
would follow in her footsteps. It should be the highest law in the land and 
should be our guide. Let's take a look in the mirror and face the real 
problem. We let ourselves deteriorate to this....So what are ""We the 
People"" going to do now? We must make wise decisions even if they are hard, 
not voting is a choice...one our children will have to live with.

518,"It was bothersome to see both a Trump rally scare as well as a Kaine 
motorcade accident occur almost simultaneously a few nights ago. I wonder 
whether the boisterous talk surround 2nd Amendment rights riles certain 
people up and gets in their heads the wrong way. That amendment shouldn't 
empower persons to rise up and do whatever comes to their minds simply 
because they feel they have some personal cause to defend. I feel in this 
21st Century era it is ripe time for the 2nd amendment to be reviewed for a 
possible rewriting so that people can receive it in its clarified intent. 
Upholding tradition is good but not so it binds the hands and feet. The 
founding fathers of the American Constitution shouldn't continue to have 
all the say on this for our times, neither a tiny minority hold any review 
process hostage causing lives to needlessly be lost. That certainly appears 
to be the root of home-grown terrorism.

Duel of the Doctors; final round! 

Between Donald, the Dentist (business mogul with honorary merits from the 
university of public opinion and high regard) vs.

Hillary, the Heart Surgeon (juris doctor too)

Specs: 

Donald pulls all kinds of teeth; Hillary could re-start hearts (provided 
that national healthcare doesn't get plucked out as well. Plus the great 
Secretary is generally conciliatory and diplomatic.

Donald is proud that he made himself rich in 'business' (using all the tax 
loopholes he could unearth along the way) but he claims Hillary made 
herself rich in 'politics' - which to him is low down and dirty. I am not 
sure why that should be objectionable and why the Secretary should not be 
able to live as well as the Donald himself. Furthermore I am of the opinion 
that Hillary rather used her wordsmith abilities and capabilities, her time 
and advice, being a learned woman of the law, added to all the fine hats 
she has worn that provided her with tremendously invaluable 
'stock-in-trade'. This should not be shameful or disdainful for anyone, I 
should think.

Donald with the many accusations and charges leveled at him from every 
quarter for acts of discrimination, assaults, tax evasion plus (Seth 
Meyers' list on CNN's Don Lemon is most conclusive). But then the grand 
master - possible 'links' with Russian espionage where they have hacked 
U.S. information systems all around. In one breath Donald says he knows the 
Russian president, in another he says he doesn't (the tapes never lie). 
Talk about corruption? Forget the orange jumpsuit, in times past this would 
have been serious treason and downright treachery.

So what were all the suppositional claims and unsubstantiated steroid 
charges levied against the Secretary Clinton founded on again? Probably an 
attempt at comparing hers and Donald's own pristine record and stellar 
virtues. We know they are stellar because Donald has not admitted 
wrongdoing on any count in any matter.

Hopefully the results of this election finally concludes the official close 
of stone throwing season. Thank you, Jesus.",-0.0993014201412,0.141613490528

negative comments about him. 
Lets compare the two real quick.

A guy who has said some politically incorrect comments about woman, and a 
guy with down syndrome.
A guy who by the way ""JOKINGLY"" said he would grab a woman's vagina... 
people always leave out the part that he was joking, and never actually 
grabbed a woman's vagina in reality.

A woman who lies to the american people on a regular basis, breaks laws and 
gets away with it, uses contribution money donated to her foundation for 
the people of Haiti to pay for her daughters wedding while being worth a 
quarter of a billion dollars.
A woman that is obviously for the establishment, 250 million dollar net 
worth from what? Does she own a business? Does she produce anything? No, 
she is worth 250 million by playing politics and taking pay checks from 
special interests... 
A woman who no one trusts or has faith in, even her closest co workers. A 
woman that is known for being a raging alcoholic again among her closest 
comrades, who are quoted in the Wikileaks emails saying she doesn't even 
make it to 9 am before she is completely drunk. And people wonder why she 
keeps falling over and collapsing... It is called being drunk.
Are you people really so blind to her corruption? Wake up and quit being a 
simple minded idiot... do a bit of research before you make an obviously 
shallow comment. 

Follow Trump back and watch what he has been saying for 30 years, then 
follow Hillary back for 30 years and look at what she has not done while in 
a position to do so. 
There is a handful of people who really call the shots, people who by the 
way give no damn about me you or anybody. They want Hillary, if that is not 
obvious to you then this comment can not help you.

We literally spend an hour of mainstream time on a man jokingly saying some 
piggish things about woman. While spending less then a few minutes covering 
Hillary's deleting 33,000 emails after receiving a federal subpoena to not 
do exactly that...
A woman who is connected to people being paid 1500$ to go and insight 
violence.

Ohh my God did that GUY saying something piggish about a WOMAN!??!?? OH MY 
GOD ARREST THAT MAN!

But wait, that woman over there broke the law about 57 million times and 
was responsible for inciting violence that actually got people hurt in real 
life as opposed to a joke that took place in a guys mind....

supply plenty of flattering words to ordinary people, but all resources 
will go to big fishes only), rigorous campaigns to suppress people's 
rationality by raising their emotional sentiments so that these people 
would be their blind followers with no genuine personal opinions, They 
justify inhuman activities, they are intolerant to minorities and they 
don't intend to uphold humanity. My opinion is.. The responsibility of 
government to take care of it's citizens cannot be handed over to profit 
minded private players. Civilised society is like a tree, reforms should 
pour on top like photosynthesis, Resources should flow from the bottom like 
water and soil nutrients, The tree will become weak if all resources are 
artificially concentrated on the fruits directly. The roots have to grow so 
that the entire tree becomes independent. Although Trump is more likely to 
support India than Clinton, I know very well, choosing an evil's attractive 
deals would always end up unfavourable. In India, the BJP is advancing well

force the government to get rid of Medicaid and put everybody on Medicare

it doesnt pay that much or SSA can keep medicaid but force to change the

I prefer trump because even through he's too instinctively ,but he is a 
strong and successful business man ,instinctively is not big trouble to be 
leader, I don't like Clinton ,the main reason is she always talks 
everythins about policy as machine , for instance : I would set up no-fly

reduce deficit for government and so so , but these cases are just

cases??? Any possible to be worse ? how do you certain your actions is

is the finish line of the race. it is a selling price. but the transaction 
doesn't account for taking people's money. it is earned money. you see the 
gold in the cave of wonder, but you do not touch it or try to take it with 
you. you see it, you see the price that it is selling for and you see the 
value of the product and then you use that to determine how much you are 
going to earn. you have to then get out and do your own thing and earn 
that. you don't take the gold. the gold doesn't belong to you. that is 
stealing. you have to earn the dollar valuation of the gold. you have to 
record it and report it. it is like weight loss. you go to a gym and you 
tell yourself that you want to lose thirty pounds. but in order to actually 
lose those thirty pounds you have to go out work out and shed off the 
weight. you have to earn it. but, i think the real question here is with 
retail stores ... if i am levi company and my jeans are being sold in 
macy's but nobody buys any of my jeans, then after a couple months when the 
seasons change and the shelves need to be restocked with the latest 
fashions why do the close get marked down in price and then donated to like 
good will and charities as opposed to returned back to me the owner as 
unsold goods. why because it was sold. it was sold through the cameras that 
work in loss prevention. it was captured and recorded by the cameras. the 
registers just don't happen to work in a way that they can process a 
payment from someone simply walking into the store. so, what happens is the

1080,"this election is a tough election because of the presidencies of the former 
campaigns. the obama administration enlisted a very strong group of young 
people that were in college to help win the office. but, now those young 
people have graduated from college. they are no longer dependents under 
their parents. they are stacked high with student loan debt so they can't 
afford credit cards and business loans or get jobs or apartments or 
anything like that for themself. what they have is a high school degree. a 
diploma. and transcripts.and social media. but the registers in the retail 
stores don't work like that. we can't let the polls in the voting locations 
work like that. so, then how do those people register to vote? and how do 
they vote. they were studying in school some in state some out of state 
they don't have a home because even if they return to their parent's home 
they are not the owner of their parents home they are just a lodger they 
might as well use a hotel address as their address for voter registration 
purposes. they don't have any money that can purchase real property, a car 
a house an apartment, so what can they do. the bush administration utilized 
military families. they utilized the war in iraq and afgghanistan and the 
absantee ballot. so, naturally there was a question and confusion of votes 
being lost in the process or votes not being counted or paper versus 
electronic votes. the clinton administration used a lot of social service 
footprints necessary to repair the war crimes of the kennedy and reagan and 
bush administrations and vietnam wars and so and so forth. so, now we are 
in a difficult position. because we have social media. and, the purpose of 
social media is to negate the lies that big business or big corporations 
were feeding us in the media in order to affect politics. the media would 
say that it is going to rain today and when a person looks outside and sees 
that it is a sunny day without a cloud in sight , then it is the recording 
of that proof on social media that ultimately saves the false accusation. 
so, within this election, unfortunately, whatever the outcome, because the 
country is in a tender point economically and politically, we don't have 
the luxury of not having a sitting president. so, the effort is not in 
whether this party or that party or this person or that person wins or 
loses. rather, it is to make sure that neither either one of our candidates 
who is determined the winner and thus the next president of the united 
states falls, and that this country its economy and political system and so 
forth should too also not fall.",-0.153425935645,-0.134676676141

FACTS and statements and criticisms made from his OWN MOUTH. If you look at 
Hillary's attack ads she does nothing but get tapes from speeches Donald 
Trump made on his campaign of arrogance and play them back. This man is an 
embarrassment to our society and a pathetic image of spoiled child that 
grew into a man. Hillary is no angel and yes she has lied , however I would 
rather vote for someone that has admitted their mistakes , owns up to them, 
and not vote for a racist asshole who blames the media , The Clinton's , 
The GOP , past and present Republican leaders for HIS OWN MISTAKES. HE IS 
BEYOND ARROGANT , A MODERN DAY HITLER AND A BAD EXAMPLE OF WHAT IS GOOD IN 
THIS COUNTRY. Please vote your conscious on Election Day and think about 
our future and most of all the future of of children.",0.0169578691674,0.106146281922
