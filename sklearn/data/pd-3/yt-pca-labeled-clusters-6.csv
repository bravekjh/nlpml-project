12,0,"How many of the American people are aware, that there are other candidates 
(e.g. Johnson & Stein) that you can vote for?"
13,0,"I'm sorry...but I think I'd feel just a tad more comfortable with the 
country in Hillary's hands than in his. His characteristics an demeanor and 
some of the things he says are so immature & outlandish I really can't 
believe he's gotten this far. I don't want someone like this representing & 
dictating us at all. His personality is just too unattractive for my 
comfort & trust levels. I loved Bill as our president, and I think she'd 
rekindle a lot of the ways he ran the country. This guy here, no ma'am...I 
just don't like this rude pushy fellow and I don't want him to be the our 
president, I just can't stand this guy. HILLARY 100%!"
14,5,"I will never understand how people can say some of the things being said 
throughout this election. No matter who you choose to vote for, it is not 
right to say any of the candidates should commit suicide or be murdered. It 
is also very silly to assume that World War III is going to breakout due to 
the results of this election, or that this country is headed towards the 
apocalypse. With that being said though, Donald Trump is the best candidate 
we could vote for, because otherwise, our country will be worse off. His 
only real competition is Hillary Clinton, who has proven herself to be a 
crooked and corrupt politician; any third-party candidate currently running 
for president stands no chance of actually winning. 


Donald Trump is nowhere near as bad as people think he is. Despite popular 
belief, he is not going to lead our country into an era of racism, sexism, 
xenophobia, or hate. Sure, he has said some pretty offensive things, but 
that just shows that he is an actual person who does not try to be 
politically correct in order to just win the vote. We have all said things 
that we regret or did not mean, and that makes us human. Politicians like 
Hillary Clinton have said things almost as bad as what Trump has said, but 
only in private. For example, as much as people like to point to out that 
Donald Trump has accused President Barack Obama of being born in Kenya, it 
was a Clinton employee who first suggested it. According to Joshua 
Muravchik in ‚ÄúHillary Clinton‚Äôs Bad Old Days‚Äù, ‚ÄúClinton-family retainer 
Sidney Blumenthal had furnished the material on Obama‚Äôs past‚Äù (34). Clinton 
is unreliable and has crooked ways, as she now claims to support Obama.


Hillary Clinton‚Äôs corruption as a politician is also demonstrated by the 
way that she can be ‚Äúbought‚Äù. Many people believe that she is nothing more 
than a puppet for large corporations and rich people that donate to her 
foundation. As Sam Frizell points out in ‚ÄúThe Benefits of Friendship with 
Hillary Clinton‚Äù, ‚Äúhalf the private individuals whom Clinton met with‚Ä¶ 
donated to the foundation. That‚Äôs 85 out of 154 people‚Äù (5). This 
contradicts a Clinton quote that Frizell also brings to attention, 
‚Äú‚ÄòDemocracy can't just be for billionaires‚Äô‚Äù (6). Donald Trump is a 
billionaire who worked throughout his life to get to this point, and will 
not be easily bought, as he is not hungry for the money. The same can not 
be said for Hillary. 


I understand why so many people are reluctant to give Donald Trump a 
chance. He‚Äôs a loudmouth who lacks political experience, but compared to 
Hillary, he is safe. He has proven that he understands the economy with the 
fact that he has done so well, and he has policies that could help our 
country. Many people may be put off by what Trump has said about some 
things, such as illegal immigrants, and his idea of ‚Äúbuilding a wall‚Äù to 
keep them from coming into the United States. Those people just 
misunderstand though, as Trump claims in his book Crippled America: How to 
Make America Great Again, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to stop legal immigration to this 
country. In fact, I would like to reform and increase immigration in some 
important ways‚Äù (29). I believe that many of his other policies may be 
misunderstood as well, but in time, if he becomes president, we will see 
that he has what is best for our country in mind. In regard to those voting 
for a third-party candidate, you are just wasting your vote. Your 
frustration with both major candidates is understandable, but please think 
about which of them will be better for our country, as you could be making 
a huge mistake by not voting for them. Donald Trump is not the only the 
most fit candidate for presidency, but perhaps the only fit candidate."

But the part of me who wants to pay fewer taxes, see the economy less

I think Hillarys plan for WW3 is more focused on helping all Americans. If 
we're all dead no one has any problems left, And its all perfectly fair. 
Death is well know for its complete lack of bias to economic standings, 
Race, Gender, Religion & Nation of origin.

Hillary is right. Death is the only fair solution and Russia can be the

was still alive I think I could talk him out of it..."
36,0,"We do all realize that Clinton is going to win right? People let's wake up 
please!"
37,0,"Voters like Trump because he talks the way they do. People always shouting 
at the tv or the computer screen about things they don't like what's going 
on in the country and other countries. Well, there is a difference. When we 
talk like that, we're not in the public's eye like tv or the internet with 
people all over the country and other countries watching us and hearing us, 
therefore, there aren't any consequences when we do it. But when a you talk 
like that in the public's eye, there ARE consequences for it and if you're 
president the consequences don't just come to you but to the country as 
well. Trump has been talking like that a lot and a lot of people don't like 
it. If you were running, would you dare talk like that in the public's eye? 
Past presidents have always been well aware of that which is why they 
always talk in cool, calm matter no matter how upset they are."

46,0,I just cant stop looking at it
47,3,"One thing is clear!
Donald Trump is businessman and he will be benefited (this could be a great 
clear reason). Hillary Clinton worked for government and country from very 
many years and she has more experience than Trump. I think that Clinton 
will be better president than Trump. We haven't seen the power of woman 
till now and now its time to. Trump could be threat to country and people 
as he could cross any limits to run his business. That's what my opinion 
says."

49,3,"#ImWithHer! Even though she's made really big mistakes in her life she

56,1,"And now Trump is breaking promise after promise, making him a very large 
liar."
57,1,TRUMP #1 THE SOUTH WILL RISE AGAIN
58,5,"Trump is like poison. Trump supporters like him because of a few reasons



1) People were so afraid of being rude and racist to others because they 
could get in trouble or hurt, but now since there is a popular racist rich 
guy, they can let everything out.

2) He owns a million dollar company. People think that with money he can do 
anything and it's true, he can bribe ANYONE into doing ANYTHING. 

3) He goes against all the stereotypes. Because of vines and websites, 
everyone has a specific thought on a person or race. Trump takes advantage 
of this and makes people hate and be afraid of these people. This helps him 
on his way to build a wall and deport millions of people. 

4) He only talks about immigrants and why Hillary is bad while Hillary 
talks about the countries status and future. But with all trump has said, 
he has made people hate Hillary.

Now the reasons why he would be. A bad president. I know Hillary has made 
mistakes and has lied and said some things, but trump has made WAY MORE 
than Hillary. 

Trump goes to Mexico, makes the president trust him, (lie), comes back and 
rants about Mexico, He said he loves Mexicans, (lie), wants to deport them, 
he says women are great and he respect them, (lie), He later goes on and 
insults them and has have been recorded with sexual assaults and racism.

If he deports people, the economy will go way down since even though many 
jobs will be open for Americans, there won't be enough to fill in the gap 
left from the millions of people that got deported. Farms will no longer be 
occupied by Mexicans and immigrants, and helpers of American farmers since 
no one will want to do those jobs causing a major depletion of food. And 
since he will stop importing things from many countries including food, 
causing more food depletion. 

Also other countries will become over populated and will cause major 
problems with increased food production needed and with many buildings left 
in America after people abandoned them, there will be thousands of acres 
worth of land wasted.




Think of the future. You hold the fate of America and the world in your 
hands. Become a hero. Choose what is right. Vote for Hillary. 




#DumpTrump #HillaryForPresident"
59,3,"‚ÄúDonald Trump is running for president.‚Äù I think we all had the same 
reaction when we heard this news but now we probably have some different 
views. Although we may disagree on many things I believe one thing we can 
agree on is that these are two of the worst candidates we‚Äôve ever had in 
American history. 
I was 100% anti-Trump when he proposed his candidacy, but through following 
the election he seems to be the best option we have in 2016. Though he has 
said some extremely radical things, such as building a wall to keep illegal 
immigrants from coming across the border, that is not a bad idea. He is not 
saying he wants to deport ALL immigrants. Trump is just enforcing a law 
because it is in fact illegal to be in America ILLEGALLY.
‚ÄúThe current official unemployment rate for Hispanics is 9.1 percent, 
compared to 7.6 percent for the nation as a whole.‚Äù It is understandable 
for Donald Trump to be upset with these numbers because they are increasing 
our country as a whole‚Äôs numbers. Hispanic voters are mostly against the 
republican party but there are ‚Äúnew forces‚Äù who are fighting for 
immigration reform and fair treatment for Latinos. 46% of voters in a poll 
agree with this statement. Some people say this is morally wrong but if you 
look back to the Sedition Act of 1798 the federalists discouraged low life 
immigrants and wanted to grant president the right to deport the unwanted. 
With that being said these views are not a new idea to a person of 
political importance. 
CNN has caught Trump in some bad situation. Such as an audio recording 
where Trump speaks of his daughter‚Äôs breasts, three-way sex, and him not 
dating women older than 35. Also, caught on the recording was talk of him 
‚Äúbarging‚Äù into beauty pageant dressing rooms. Trumps running mate, Mike 
Pence, says he is ‚Äúdistraught about all of Trumps doings.‚Äù Although this 
may be true his disrespect does not even amount to the torture and acts of 
malice toward women by Isis. Trump will still provide women with the same 
opportunities as others in a professional manner."

You have the choice between Trump, an unscrupulous Businessman and Clinton, 
a woman that did some very poor decisions during her life; but she is the 
only chance for America. Obama did something wrong, like any other 
president too, cause nobody's perfect, but he did steps into the right 
direction and Clinton can expand this. America is stronger together, 
America dont need someone who is trying to divide its people into Muslims, 
Hispanics and Americans. In my country, guns are prohibited and it works 
very well. We dont have a shoot-out in a public school every two months and 
that high amount of firearm deaths. Trump wants to keep his Citizens safe 
and create prosperity but he denies the gunfact. Clinton however tries like 
Obama too, to decrease the amount of weapons. In fact, if you elect Trump 
for the next 4 years, you have to life with the consequences, and not just 
you, the whole world has to deal with this decision. So, do yourself and 
the world a favor and vote for Clinton. Reality has no rewind

89,5,"I am only 12 years old and this is my only off day and I'm spending my time 
looking at the presidential debate because I really want to understand 
what's going around in my world. people that vote for Donald Trump are just 
looking about how much money he has and I just probably bribed in some way 
, but Hillary Clinton will be the perfect person for the job. I don't know 
much about the presidential debate because I am so long but from what I 
hear I think Hillary Clinton is the best person for the job because she 
gets her point across and she's very thorough about how she will make 
America great again. people like Donald Trump are business owners and all 
they care about is money now I'm not saying that Donald Trump is in a good 
person in that doesn't his point across but he doesn't really focus on the 
topic.Now you can look at both sides Donald Trump wants to make it legal 
for anyone to be able to have a gun and he wants to build a wall to reduce 
the amount of immigration. Hillary Clinton wants back background checks on 
people when they are trying to purchase a gun for our safety as well as for 
kids and she wants to reduce the amount of poverty in America by making 
things more affordable especially when it comes to people that are able to 
afford for their children to go to college. I understand why Donald Trump 
is coming from when he wants to keep out people that will harm us but it 
still doesn't mean that people that have been here for hundreds and 
hundreds of years they should just go back to somewhere that wasn't either 
comfortable or a good position for their families. Hillary Clinton wants us 
all to be equal. the presidential debate is really confusing for someone my 
age but the only things that I take out of it is that Hillary Clinton will 
provide safety and money for people in need and for children. Hillary 
Clinton is not selfish and cares about others before thinking about 
herself. #Hillary Clinton 2016"

It's only propaganda and lies.
If you want another world war, vote Hillary Killary Hitlary Clinton. If 
not, vote for the candidate of hope - Donald Trump who will do his best to 
make America great and respectable again."
142,4,"Yeah Trump lost me the second he called Mexicans ""bad hombres"". Why people 
still support him I have no clue. You can go all you want into the ""oh 
Hillary is all talk and no action"", but people in government today don't 
like Trump either, even in the Republican party. He wants to make Mexico 
pay for the wall? Great, that's another diplomatic relationship down the 
crapper. Congress won't approve anything he wants to do. Hillary is 
conventional but competent. Trump is neither. He is a racist, misogynist, 
and completely opposed to the idea of religious freedom, which is what 
brought the first pilgrims here in the first place. Hillary is not a 
fantastic candidate by any means, and if she were running against anyone 
else, she would probably lose. But under Trump, the united states will fall 
into ruin."
143,3,"Trump is a man with a big ego for himself and don't care about anything or

for Hillary. Greetings from Europe."
158,3,"hahaha Trump is an ugly mf. he does the funniest gestures with his hands, 
his squinting eyes look at her when he doesn't agree. hahaha he is actually 
entertaining, and I actually like Trump, he does bring up some good points 
every now, and then. overall throughout these 3 debates it seems that he 
can't follow the structure of the debate, and just answer the questions, it 
always veers off to another topic, about something he's probably repeated 
10 times already lol. I like Trump, but he doesn't seem like he's as fit 
for the job as Hillary is, she's a damn politician, these debates, these 
presidential races are formatted for politicians lol. I'm going to give 
Trump some credit for his efforts being the non politician, too bad he 
wasn't prepared better."

election he would start world war 3 on the other hand Hillary is a good

the United States of America and that profs that woman can be anything."

163,3,trump is right for america like icebergs were right for the titanic
164,0,"For the coming US election, it's quite simple the choice you have to make. 
If you want to see real change with a better economical environment you 
vote for Trump, if you are very conservative and don't want to see big 
changes and want the same elite at the top, you vote for Clinton. And most 
importantly, don't make your choice based on the media, because the media 
is also controlled by this elite. The media has taken one side in this 
election, since the very beginning. And whatever they can do to hurt the 
Trump campaign, they have done it."

independently. I'M WAITING FOR A WOMAN WHO PAVED HER OWN WAY."

0, litterally 0 time Clinton. I for one don't really care what happens to 
this country since I'm no USAian, but I find this very interesting and it's

being investigated for a crime while running for pres and btw the FBI just 
reopened that investigation, & congress already reopened it because they 
most of congress disagree with FBI director Comey who was either paid off 
by her or threatened by her same as our AG Lynch, but how could they even 
have a fair investigation when the current pres is for her obviously the 
FBI was being leaned on very heavily to not do they're jobs, anybody else 
would've at the very least have their security clearance taken away so how 
can u have a pres who shouldn't even be allowed to have a security

stats like that without help she has always used notes and such to deliver 
speeches if she was talking without it there would be more of a slower 
delivery, she looks down all throughout the speech getting help how does 
she have anything on the podium if she didnt know any of the questions or 
things that would go on. We do need to protect our borders and fix the VA 
and end NAFTA and the tariff against foreign trade would keep jobs here"
179,3,"Trump claims that the polls will be rigged but already there have been 
charges out on people like a woman name Terri Lynn who was charged for 
double voting at the polls. Ironically, she claimed after being charged 
that she was worried that the polls were rigged. Sooooo, she she decided to

State being more corrupt than any person to ever run for the Office of 
President Of The United States, it is and was inevitable that someone 
other than established politicians would run. It was also inevitable 
that they would win. Why you may ask? Or not. Because more and more 
citizens of this country have become disgusted with the way The United 
States is going. Progressives, eie the party of Woodrow Wilson, FDR, 
Truman ect did not and do not believe in the Constitution and Bill of 
Rights as a living and just as important document as it was in the 
founding of our country. Little by little, because we do not pay 
attention, we are having our freedoms taken from us. Our short attention
spans will be the destruction of our country as we have known it in the
past. Progressive thought is that the government not only should but 
has the right to involve itself in our live by taking responsibility for
things the Constitution and the Bill of Rights did not give it 
permission and in some cases out right forbid it to do or take. What we 
saw happen in this election is a direct response to a government out of 
control. Americans are waking up. It had to happen sooner or later and 
sooner is best. It is people like Sarah Trachtenburg that think that 
electing a 
person like Clinton is ok even if she is corrupt, a traitor, a betrayer 
of employees of her own department, Benghazi, even if she furthers her 
and Bill's own fortunes off of the relief funds headed to victims of 
terrible events in this world. Even if she has no care for slain 
Americans and can go before Congress and say, and I quote, ""What 
difference does it make."" And even if she can lie through her teeth and 
everyone knows she is lying through her teeth. Have you ever wondered 
why many people who have crossed her are no longer heard from or around?
Yes it is those like Sarah who will be the death of freedom in this 
country. I may not see it. I am 63. But my 20 grandchildren will pay for
our folly and this is Truth."

258,3,"Republican voters don't want Hillary because they don't think she's a good 
politician. If it's a good politician they want, then why in the primaries 
did they vote for Donald Trump, guy who is not a politician and has no 
political experience to say the least? Marco Rubio was a lot more qualified 
to be president than Trump, so was Ted Cruz. Hell, even Jeb Bush was more 
qualified. What honestly made people believe that Trump was more qualified 
than the other Republican nominees?
Voters have said that Trump talks just the way they do. That's because 
Trump's not a politician just like most of the voters aren't. They don't 
know things work in office. And if Trump becomes president, he's going to 
find out the hard way how things work and is going to realize, very 
quickly, that he's in over his head and that running for president was a 
huge mistake. If Trump realizes that he's in over his head, he's not going 
to resign even if he's advised to because he'll tell his advisors, ""No, if 
I resign then everyone is going to know that I couldn't do this job and if 
that happens, my image will be ruined."" To people like Trump, their image 
is more important than the well-being of the country."

265,3,"Leader Trump

When the word, ‚Äúleader‚Äù, goes through your mind, do you think of a man or 
woman? Obviously, a woman can be just as or even more manly than a man can 
be. But image is very important to our enemies way of thinking which leads 
to their decisions. Trump is only going to do good things to our military 
and create a GREATLY, assertive image upon our threats. Security is a 
beautiful thing and will keep so much stress away from our minds.

With being president comes great power and with great power, Trump knows 
good and well about great responsibility. Donald Trump seems to have a good 
perspective of responsibility. He has already proven how responsible he is 
with his decision making as a business man. Just from impressions, it might 
seem that he makes risky decisions but within the past decades he hasn‚Äôt 
showed us anything but success and extreme productivity. Trump may be 
drastically different, but that also means that he is an ,outside of the 
box, thinker, for example, ‚ÄúHe tends to buy properties that have less of an 
upside if they also are a safer choice (i.e., less downside).‚Äù.

America‚Äôs debt simply and literally needs conservation because of all of 
our investments being made in the last 2 terms. Trump is only bringing 
notice to the most effective problems that don't try to focus on as many 
people‚Äôs feelings as possible. He will not make ignorant decisions because 
he has gained more than he has lost from bankruptcy and gained an unlimited 
amount of resources to make him all around successful. Donald Trump has 
proven that he is active and willing to put in work because of his rapid 
amount of trial and error.

Every penny counts as Donald Trump just wants to save/make money along with 
growing our economy more efficiently than ever before. He has a plan to 
reduce most taxes. Trump is tremendously serious about calculations to set 
his goals higher than most people are ready for. Because of most people 
thinking that taxes are inevitable, they just assume that we will lose so 
much money if we cut them but if Trump becomes president I strongly believe 
that money will be one of the least of our worries.

Currently, among our peers and media, we see how Trump supporters just do 
not ‚Äúfit in‚Äù. All the youngins these days just won‚Äôt open their mind up a 
little because they never imagined him and his different ideologies 
proceeding in politics. Our fairly new generations don‚Äôt understand how 
Trump is the actual republican candidate. Our media has convinced so many 
people that Trump is the most unsophisticated choice, therefore, they also 
want to convince more people to not vote for Trump. This, of course, leads 
to making many republicans feel that Trump just can‚Äôt be an option because 
of the pressure other peers have put on them."

277,0,"Please take the time to read this, like to show that you still care




If you have any emotions as a human left, don't vote for trump. I am 
Hispanic and my parents came from Mexico because they had to look for a 
job. They were separated from their grand parents and parents for many 
years, and now their grandparents can't even come and visit us, not even my 
uncle! My parents will end up being deported leaving me, my sister and my 
pet helpless with no food, water, or money. I may very likely be spending 
my time living in my school. That's not all, over 5,000,000 kids will be 
left alone with no one to help them. Even if we do get help, we will still 
be separated from our loving parents. And over 300 people have said that 
they will commit suicide if trump wins. Not to mention the other deaths 
caused by homeless children and innocent immigrants who have lost 
everything they have worked for. My mom has worked for Allstate for 13 
years and has recently opened up her own agency with Allstate after 4 years 
of school, traveling, and work. My dad has helped many Americans with work 
and projects as well not criticize anyone even if they are racist, 
American, or African American. My mom tries to save lives and supports many 
organizations and has donated thousands of dollars to programs trying to 
save lives.Also think about it, Abraham Lincoln tried his best to keep this 
country together but got killed for his efforts.Martin Luther King Jr. not 
only helped fight for equal rights for African Americans, but Mexicans, 
Hispanics, Muslims, women, and other immigrants who were struggling getting 
a better life.Do you really want a president who is a racist jerk who only 
cares about his own personal gain? I do agree that there are some bad 
people that do some bad crimes, but you don't see trump putting all the 
American criminals and serial killers in jail! Choose what is right. The 
fate of America and millions of lives rests in your hands. You can be a 
hero or a villain. You hold the power. Choose what's right.

in the world, that is NOrht America has been great since the Kennedy's, a 
bit before, till now, still is the main power in the world, that is when 
America has been greatn much as for many americans other parts of their 
history seems to tbe the great ones. Greatness brings with it actions 
people question, such as Guantalamo,however who can doubt it, America is 
still great, jgreatly good or greatly less good but great. It is the

326,0,"I don't understand why people come here illegally? Like, why not just take 
the necessary steps you need to be a legal immigrant? It either must be a 
super complicated process to get in, or so bad on the other side of the 
border that people are driven by desperation. Why even risk being separated 
from your family though? Because if Trump's plan to deport all illegals 
immigrants follows through, then that's probably what's going to happen, 
and they'll have no one to blame but themselves for coming here illegally 
in the first place. How are they getting through anyway? Don't we have 
people patrolling the borders? Are they being bribed, or is the border too 
extensive for them that they can't monitor every inch of it?....I just 
don't understand how it all works."

363,5,"Arguably the answer at 1:18:00 was the worst moment for Hillary. She gets 
asked a question about her No-Fly-Zone policy, doesn't seem to answer it, 
and does nothing to quell any fears that her presidency could lead to war 
with Russia. Instead, she talks about the refugee crisis which has nothing 
to do with anything"

429,0,"Dear Hillary Supporters,
I'm 28 years old. Never voted in my life before this election. Why? I 
always felt that the candidates running were always similar to the ones 
running previously. Nothing ever stood out to me. Until this election.

Donald Trump absolutely has his flaws. Not wording things the right way, 
gets angry quick, acts childish, doesn't sound politically correct 
etc......... but i want you to watch him and take a good look at him in the 
past few months. Watch his demeanor. This is a man who doesn't need this 
position. A billionaire who can retire and live a very pleasant life. He 
spent over 100 million dollars so far, has been ridiculed and scorn by the 
media and still has the energy to attend 7 rallies in a day. Let me say 
that again SEVEN RALLIES IN A DAY!

Instead of piggybacking with the media and the celebrities, take a real 
good look at this mans work ethic. Look into his eyes and see the sincerity 
in them. Take a look at his family. My father once told me you can tell a 
lot about a man from his family. His family is respectful, they know that 
hard work brings great things and they know that together they are stronger.

Vote for Hillary if you want, but in the end all you will get with her is 
the same damn thing you got with Obama. Just another politician.

Take a chance with Donald J. Trump. Be unique in a room full of followers. 
Who cares if Lady Gaga or Bon Jovi Or Jay Z backs her for God knows 
whatever reason. Be unique and stand up for what you truly believe in. I 
guarantee, what you believe in, is what Trump wants to make happen in this 
great country we call America.

God Bless You & GET OUT AND VOTE!"
430,0,Oh wait... This is the real one.... I thought this was an SNL parody
431,3,"Hillary Clinton may not know that's she might just be following in Bills 
foot steps but it would not be wrong if she becomes the president of 
America but if Donild trump was to no that within all the reason why no 
body wouldn't have trump to win but unless she was the one who was married 
to former president which she will have the power over trump"

Wallace did a much better job monitoring this debate than any of the others

sir."
436,0,"Before the voting they said there is a 75-85% change Silly Hilly would win

494,0,"I am very disturbed by the current political situation. I hear a lot about 
picking the candidate which represents the ""lesser"" evil. Really? Why would 
we want to vote for evil at all? This debate rages, all the while we ignore 
the bigger evil/elephant in the room. We have brought this situation upon 
ourselves. Our Constitution begins with ""We the People.."" not They the 
Politicians. The current state of affairs, or the lack of a good political 
candidate is not the fault of any political party it is the fault of We the 
People. We have become lazy and complacent. We don't want to have to work 
to solve our problems we would rather give them to someone else along with 
the power and authority. We are so complacent in letting others take care 
of things we are even willing to give up our rights as guaranteed in the 
Constitution itself. We have turned Washington from a garden of democracy 
to a cesspool of decadence. America worked because We the People, as a 
whole, stood for something. We always took the higher road. You can't 
legislate morality, it must come from the society. A society that works and 
cares for its individuals. We no longer want to work for what we get 
material or otherwise, we want it handed to us. This sense of entitlement 
is destroying the fundamental principles used to build this country. We 
don't want to face problems in our communities, we want someone else to do 
that. We are even willing to let the state raise our children. It's time to 
wake up! We are the problem. We have become sheep. Why do we allow politics 
to become a career? Why don't we hold our representatives to the same 
higher moral code we want to tread? Why do we let the media tell us what is 
and is not correct? We the People should set the standards, We the People 
should wake up and start caring about our neighbors, our communities and 
our country. The Constitution of the United States is a divinely inspired 
document which paved the way for not only one great nation, but many which 
would follow in her footsteps. It should be the highest law in the land and 
should be our guide. Let's take a look in the mirror and face the real 
problem. We let ourselves deteriorate to this....So what are ""We the 
People"" going to do now? We must make wise decisions even if they are hard, 
not voting is a choice...one our children will have to live with.
Evil triumphs when good men stand by and do nothing!"

518,5,"It was bothersome to see both a Trump rally scare as well as a Kaine 
motorcade accident occur almost simultaneously a few nights ago. I wonder 
whether the boisterous talk surround 2nd Amendment rights riles certain 
people up and gets in their heads the wrong way. That amendment shouldn't 
empower persons to rise up and do whatever comes to their minds simply 
because they feel they have some personal cause to defend. I feel in this 
21st Century era it is ripe time for the 2nd amendment to be reviewed for a 
possible rewriting so that people can receive it in its clarified intent. 
Upholding tradition is good but not so it binds the hands and feet. The 
founding fathers of the American Constitution shouldn't continue to have 
all the say on this for our times, neither a tiny minority hold any review 
process hostage causing lives to needlessly be lost. That certainly appears 
to be the root of home-grown terrorism.

Duel of the Doctors; final round! 

Between Donald, the Dentist (business mogul with honorary merits from the 
university of public opinion and high regard) vs.

Hillary, the Heart Surgeon (juris doctor too)

Specs: 

Donald pulls all kinds of teeth; Hillary could re-start hearts (provided 
that national healthcare doesn't get plucked out as well. Plus the great 
Secretary is generally conciliatory and diplomatic.

Donald is proud that he made himself rich in 'business' (using all the tax 
loopholes he could unearth along the way) but he claims Hillary made 
herself rich in 'politics' - which to him is low down and dirty. I am not 
sure why that should be objectionable and why the Secretary should not be 
able to live as well as the Donald himself. Furthermore I am of the opinion 
that Hillary rather used her wordsmith abilities and capabilities, her time 
and advice, being a learned woman of the law, added to all the fine hats 
she has worn that provided her with tremendously invaluable 
'stock-in-trade'. This should not be shameful or disdainful for anyone, I 
should think.

Donald with the many accusations and charges leveled at him from every 
quarter for acts of discrimination, assaults, tax evasion plus (Seth 
Meyers' list on CNN's Don Lemon is most conclusive). But then the grand 
master - possible 'links' with Russian espionage where they have hacked 
U.S. information systems all around. In one breath Donald says he knows the 
Russian president, in another he says he doesn't (the tapes never lie). 
Talk about corruption? Forget the orange jumpsuit, in times past this would 
have been serious treason and downright treachery.

So what were all the suppositional claims and unsubstantiated steroid 
charges levied against the Secretary Clinton founded on again? Probably an 
attempt at comparing hers and Donald's own pristine record and stellar 
virtues. We know they are stellar because Donald has not admitted 
wrongdoing on any count in any matter.

Hopefully the results of this election finally concludes the official close 
of stone throwing season. Thank you, Jesus."

negative comments about him. 
Lets compare the two real quick.

A guy who has said some politically incorrect comments about woman, and a 
guy with down syndrome.
A guy who by the way ""JOKINGLY"" said he would grab a woman's vagina... 
people always leave out the part that he was joking, and never actually 
grabbed a woman's vagina in reality.

A woman who lies to the american people on a regular basis, breaks laws and 
gets away with it, uses contribution money donated to her foundation for 
the people of Haiti to pay for her daughters wedding while being worth a 
quarter of a billion dollars.
A woman that is obviously for the establishment, 250 million dollar net 
worth from what? Does she own a business? Does she produce anything? No, 
she is worth 250 million by playing politics and taking pay checks from 
special interests... 
A woman who no one trusts or has faith in, even her closest co workers. A 
woman that is known for being a raging alcoholic again among her closest 
comrades, who are quoted in the Wikileaks emails saying she doesn't even 
make it to 9 am before she is completely drunk. And people wonder why she 
keeps falling over and collapsing... It is called being drunk.
Are you people really so blind to her corruption? Wake up and quit being a 
simple minded idiot... do a bit of research before you make an obviously 
shallow comment. 

Follow Trump back and watch what he has been saying for 30 years, then 
follow Hillary back for 30 years and look at what she has not done while in 
a position to do so. 
There is a handful of people who really call the shots, people who by the 
way give no damn about me you or anybody. They want Hillary, if that is not 
obvious to you then this comment can not help you.

We literally spend an hour of mainstream time on a man jokingly saying some 
piggish things about woman. While spending less then a few minutes covering 
Hillary's deleting 33,000 emails after receiving a federal subpoena to not 
do exactly that...
A woman who is connected to people being paid 1500$ to go and insight 
violence.

Ohh my God did that GUY saying something piggish about a WOMAN!??!?? OH MY 
GOD ARREST THAT MAN!

But wait, that woman over there broke the law about 57 million times and 
was responsible for inciting violence that actually got people hurt in real 
life as opposed to a joke that took place in a guys mind....

Ohh thats no big deal, the guy is definitely the bad guy here... you anti 
Trump people are silly."

635,0,"India is right now ruled by a corrupt communal party named BJP. The ideas 
of India's BJP and Trump has lot of similarities like their support to 
Crony capitalism, ignorance to sustainable development, mesmerizing words 
on country's superficial economic progress (they never feel scarce to 
supply plenty of flattering words to ordinary people, but all resources 
will go to big fishes only), rigorous campaigns to suppress people's 
rationality by raising their emotional sentiments so that these people 
would be their blind followers with no genuine personal opinions, They 
justify inhuman activities, they are intolerant to minorities and they 
don't intend to uphold humanity. My opinion is.. The responsibility of 
government to take care of it's citizens cannot be handed over to profit 
minded private players. Civilised society is like a tree, reforms should 
pour on top like photosynthesis, Resources should flow from the bottom like 
water and soil nutrients, The tree will become weak if all resources are 
artificially concentrated on the fruits directly. The roots have to grow so 
that the entire tree becomes independent. Although Trump is more likely to 
support India than Clinton, I know very well, choosing an evil's attractive 
deals would always end up unfavourable. In India, the BJP is advancing well 
by acquiring complete control over India with their ideas that are against 
the basic principles of India's constitution."

a sociologist to analyse people's interactions, behaviour and notice issues 
surrounding the community of a nation at large,
a decorated top police officer/commissioner who knows all about law and

a top engineer who knows all about construction and pioneering for the 
future,
a renowned scientist to instigate scientific research valuable to the 
country,,
a financial analyst/actuary to do the best job at keeping the country's 
finances in order,
a medical researcher to advocate for medical/hospital needs
an educator that can speak for all education sectors (primary, secondary, 
and all kinds of tertiary),
a civilian to represent the needs of the people.

That's how the single top job should be redistributed. Perhaps throw in a

Or I would hike in tax from richmen for heathcare deal of Obama. I would 
reduce deficit for government and so so , but these cases are just 
‚Äúcases‚Äù,what's reason for case??? How are your actions going to solve 
cases??? Any possible to be worse ? how do you certain your actions is 
strong and thorough to fix trouble , I never see her try to comment that . 
this is what trouble that trump most hit her :she has no judgment. Her way 
of thinking just ‚Äúif you have headache,let me check head ,if you have 
feetache ,let me check feet‚Äù her policy prefers to solve public opinion but 
trouble itself . trump's way of thinking is going to analyze what cuases 
these cases , even through he has no enough of experience in the detail 
because he has no enough of time . but he is really to try to solve trouble 
.

Most of government become to fall and unefficient , that's not reasoned by 
democratic or autocratic . they just become to acting as‚Äùif you headache 
,let me check head ,or feet let me check feet too ‚Äù,become to dirty 
politician and joker to show by foolish common."

deregulisation of big industry, less tax for the rich and for big business, 
we have come to a situation in which billionaires are the thing. I myself, 
when I have money, find myself spending it in the shops of the richest men 
in the world Starbucks etc., money does not trickle down it goes on a 
moving staircases and lifts up to the rich.
I spend money on the Koch brothers when i buy petrol, Zara, Wall Mart, this 
last is where i would spend it if i lived in the USA, Macdonalds, 
Smithfeilds, etc., my money goes straight back up to the richest men in the 
world, it does not trickle down. These big industries need to be taxed as 
they used to be in days when the well fare state was the fashion. 
The government pays out the money which it takes in taxes to teachers, 
those who work building roads and other public works schols hospitals, to 
doctors and nurses, while the money of the small man get spent with Steve 
Jobs or Bill Gates, goes straight back to the richest men in the world. It 
is governments which can change the enormouse, more or less monopolies that 
take all the money in the world, not the man on the street trying not to 
use the shops of the richest men in the world.
Laiser Faire as the liberterian economics was called in the nineteenth 
century had to be given up because at the end of the nineteenth century 
because it created monopolies and what we have now is to many more or less 
monopolies and it is a change in economic policies that changes that and 
such a change is not part of the end game of the right. We need Clinton who 
will put the balance back, who will reduce the money of the super rich by 
taxiung tghem and their businesses, businesses which have become so 
ridiculously over the top rich now that they are super millionaires and put 
it back into circulation amoung the less rich."

is the finish line of the race. it is a selling price. but the transaction 
doesn't account for taking people's money. it is earned money. you see the 
gold in the cave of wonder, but you do not touch it or try to take it with 
you. you see it, you see the price that it is selling for and you see the 
value of the product and then you use that to determine how much you are 
going to earn. you have to then get out and do your own thing and earn 
that. you don't take the gold. the gold doesn't belong to you. that is 
stealing. you have to earn the dollar valuation of the gold. you have to 
record it and report it. it is like weight loss. you go to a gym and you 
tell yourself that you want to lose thirty pounds. but in order to actually 
lose those thirty pounds you have to go out work out and shed off the 
weight. you have to earn it. but, i think the real question here is with 
retail stores ... if i am levi company and my jeans are being sold in 
macy's but nobody buys any of my jeans, then after a couple months when the 
seasons change and the shelves need to be restocked with the latest 
fashions why do the close get marked down in price and then donated to like 
good will and charities as opposed to returned back to me the owner as 
unsold goods. why because it was sold. it was sold through the cameras that 
work in loss prevention. it was captured and recorded by the cameras. the 
registers just don't happen to work in a way that they can process a 
payment from someone simply walking into the store. so, what happens is the 
clothes are left abandoned and unclaimed. they were purchased. but they 
were left in lost and found."

1080,0,"this election is a tough election because of the presidencies of the former 
campaigns. the obama administration enlisted a very strong group of young 
people that were in college to help win the office. but, now those young 
people have graduated from college. they are no longer dependents under 
their parents. they are stacked high with student loan debt so they can't 
afford credit cards and business loans or get jobs or apartments or 
anything like that for themself. what they have is a high school degree. a 
diploma. and transcripts.and social media. but the registers in the retail 
stores don't work like that. we can't let the polls in the voting locations 
work like that. so, then how do those people register to vote? and how do 
they vote. they were studying in school some in state some out of state 
they don't have a home because even if they return to their parent's home 
they are not the owner of their parents home they are just a lodger they 
might as well use a hotel address as their address for voter registration 
purposes. they don't have any money that can purchase real property, a car 
a house an apartment, so what can they do. the bush administration utilized 
military families. they utilized the war in iraq and afgghanistan and the 
absantee ballot. so, naturally there was a question and confusion of votes 
being lost in the process or votes not being counted or paper versus 
electronic votes. the clinton administration used a lot of social service 
footprints necessary to repair the war crimes of the kennedy and reagan and 
bush administrations and vietnam wars and so and so forth. so, now we are 
in a difficult position. because we have social media. and, the purpose of 
social media is to negate the lies that big business or big corporations 
were feeding us in the media in order to affect politics. the media would 
say that it is going to rain today and when a person looks outside and sees 
that it is a sunny day without a cloud in sight , then it is the recording 
of that proof on social media that ultimately saves the false accusation. 
so, within this election, unfortunately, whatever the outcome, because the 
country is in a tender point economically and politically, we don't have 
the luxury of not having a sitting president. so, the effort is not in 
whether this party or that party or this person or that person wins or 
loses. rather, it is to make sure that neither either one of our candidates 
who is determined the winner and thus the next president of the united 
states falls, and that this country its economy and political system and so 
forth should too also not fall."

1137,1,gimmie that trump
1138,3,"The system is rigged because Gary Johnson and Jill Stein were not in the 
debates. Trump is just a whiney privileged loser who knows he will lose. 
This is the only reason he is saying the election will be rigged against 
him."
1139,3,KILLARY IS EVIL VOTE TRUMP
1140,3,whos vote trump :D

1143,5,"insight: would you vote for a candidate that NBC promotes???  do you trust 
the news? wow.  watch the last 30 min as they lift up Hillary on a silver 
platter. I don't trust Trump---- but DAMMMM do I not trust Hillary. any 
time the news tells you something remember George Carlin:  ITS ALL 
BULLSHIT. AND ITS BAD FOR YOU."
1144,0,We'll either have a racist or a racist for president. wonderful.
1145,0,lmao
1146,0,don't take away guns
1147,5,"Donald ""dumb ass Trump"" is literally shaking in anger as she corners him on 
FACTS and statements and criticisms made from his OWN MOUTH. If you look at 
Hillary's attack ads she does nothing but get tapes from speeches Donald 
Trump made on his campaign of arrogance and play them back. This man is an 
embarrassment to our society and a pathetic image of spoiled child that 
grew into a man. Hillary is no angel and yes she has lied , however I would 
rather vote for someone that has admitted their mistakes , owns up to them, 
and not vote for a racist asshole who blames the media , The Clinton's , 
The GOP , past and present Republican leaders for HIS OWN MISTAKES. HE IS 
BEYOND ARROGANT , A MODERN DAY HITLER AND A BAD EXAMPLE OF WHAT IS GOOD IN 
THIS COUNTRY. Please vote your conscious on Election Day and think about 
our future and most of all the future of of children."
1148,5,Hillary is stupid
1149,1,Trump is due in court *on 12/16/16* for raping a 13 year-old girl!
1150,5,"Hillary is such an evil human being, how could a single person ever vote 
for her?"
1151,0,"I want that piece of crap to lose so badly and see his stupid face when he 
does"
1152,5,"Under investigation by the FBI and clearly a racist, how does mainstream 
media keep defending Hillary?

1153,5,"i agree with trump on so much. but hillary would make so many more educated 
decisions. if abortion is made illegal you are going to end up with a 
country of people from the ghetto on welfare and food stamps üòÇ. oh geez. i 
also dont see trump saying anything about becoming eco friendly and 
sustainable. hillary is the one if the states are going to have a very 
competent first woman president anytime soon."
1154,0,it's impossible for this guy's to be elected in United States of America
1155,5,"Oh, yay, cause' I want to vote for someone who might trigger WW111 with her 
stupid no fly zones. Every vote you put towards Hillary will destroy the 
country"
1156,5,"Hillary has been in office for 30 year. Their is no reason for her not to 
be president. Just don't vote Republic üòâ"
1157,5,"Donald Trump is sexist and racist and we should not let him lead us, 
Hillary should be our next president"

1161,0,"A drone can easily scale the height of a wall. The tax money could be used 
for a lot of other more important issues like the homeless refugees. 
Winters around the corner and they need all our help."
1162,0,"They're both fighting for what's right for America, but they took different 
paths to achieve it."
1163,5,"Trump: World War III Clinton: American Civil war III'm going with Hillary 
guys even though she's bad"
1164,0,omg you Americans all need Jesus I swear üòÇ
1165,0,"I pity for common Americans, you are told wat to do or think by your media."
1166,3,"Her ideas about immigration are frankly scary. And I hate how she always 
smiles like an idiot whenever Trump says something she disagrees with. She 
should just stop smiling, this isn't a beauty pagent. She looks so fake and 
most of the things she says are in contradiction with things she has said 
or done in the past. 
I'm not saying Trump is perfect, but honestly... as we say in France, il 
faut choisir le moins pire (pick the ""less worst"") lol. 
Good luck guys!"
1167,0,Hilary sucks
1168,3,"Trump is just lieng about everything and many racist, supremacist, and 
bigot republicans are loving it."
