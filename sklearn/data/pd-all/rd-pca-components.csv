244,"So some of my personal highlights from Trump's dumpster fire performance:

* Claims that not paying any federal tax makes him smart thereby admitting he doesn't pay any federal tax.

* Claims he will release all his taxes as soon as his audit is finished, followed immediately by claims he has been under audit for 15 years.

* When confronted with accusations that he didn't pay an architect for designing one of his clubhouses he defends it because ""maybe he wasn't happy with the work done"".

* Claims that stop and frisk wasn't ruled unconstitutional, then blames the ruling on an anti-police judge.

* Claims he is not racist because he settled an anti-discrimination lawsuit out of court, and then brags that it was easy to do.

* Claims that he was doing a service to Obama by forcing him to produce his birth certificate.

* Spends 5 minutes on an unstoppable, and fiery, rant about how claims he was a supporter of the invasion of Iraq are wrong, and within 30 seconds of ending claims that he has the best temperament.

* Claims that shooting an Iranian navy ship for taunting US ships wouldn't start a war.

* Criticizing Clinton for not being polite enough to President Obama during the 2008 Primary Debates

* Congratulating himself for not being as big of an asshole as he could have been (""I could have said some real nasty stuff about Hillary"")

* Claiming that Clinton has been fighting ISIS ""as long as she's been alive"" and seemingly holding her personally accountable for every single bad thing that has happened in the USA in the last 30 years

* Says that China or Iran should take military action against North Korea

* Says that he - the man running for president of the United States - doesn't think very much about NATO, the military alliance that's one of the cornerstones of our foreign policy

* Imploring Lester Holt and the audience to ""call Sean Hannity"" about his support of the Iraq war, as if what he said privately to a fringe-right talk show host is more important than his public statements in favor of the war",-0.0126801991449,-0.0395527766273

Trump made so many flubs and mistakes in the debate. It was pretty hard to keep count. But the biggest one in my opinion was how he buckled down on wanting to blow up an Iranian sailing vessel for taunting us.

TO SHOOT AT ANOTHER VESSEL IS AN ACT OF WAR. That will definitely start a war. And a war with a power that, if they don't currently have nuclear weapons, was at least 2 steps away from having them.

Not only does it tell our soldiers that it's alright to objectify and abuse women, but it justifies the broader scope of ""locker room talk"" which the military is already attempting to curtail. How can you tell a Private in the Army that he can't make sexually aggressive comments when he can go online and see the man at the top of his chain-of-command saying the exact same thing and excusing it as acceptable talk for men-among-men.

• No handshake surprised everyone I think. I wonder if their campaigns discussed this beforehand.

• Trump looked constipated and defeated from the get-go. Adopted a soft voice but couldn't help himself and settled into his usual aggression early on.

• Return of the sniffing.

• Anderson Cooper and Martha Raddatz came prepared and took no shit.

• A reality TV star dragged up rape claims against a former President in front of his wife and millions of people… and that cut to Bill's shocked face... what a time to be alive.

• So much petulance from Trump about time limits throughout. 

• ""If I were President at that time, [Captain Khan] would have been alive today.""

• Trump's genius military plan to defeat ISIS: ""Make it a sneak attack"".

• Probably the best soundbite of the night: ""Because you'll be in jail"".

• No knockout blow from Hillary but at this point her opponent has already been carried from the ring and is on his way to the morgue. 

• That last question. Name something positive that you respect about your opponent. Amazing.

Not only does it tell our soldiers that it's alright to objectify and abuse women, but it justifies the broader scope of ""locker room talk"" which the military is already attempting to curtail.

Conversely, it gave Clinton an opportunity to really face the 'tough' questions and hammer home solid answers (though she certainly pivoted from a few questions I think we all would've liked some more direct answers to).

In total, I think the debate was a microcosm of what (some of) Fox News and mainstream conservatives feel about Trump and the election - they don't like Clinton, but they know Trump is an asshat and a terrible choice.  I thought Wallace did a service by giving questions that allowed Clinton to really speak directly to the fears of moderate conservatives, and really make her case as being a perfectly acceptable and reasonable candidate for President - not this crazy boogie man that the alt-right and hardliners have...trumped...her up to be.

Saudi Arabia, nothing but money. We protect Saudi Arabia. Why aren't they paying?   She immediately -- when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO. Why aren't the NATO questioned -- why aren't they paying? Because they weren't paying. Since I did this -- this was a year ago -- all of a sudden, they're paying. And I've been given a lot -- a lot of credit for it. All of a sudden, they're starting to pay up. They have to pay up. We're protecting people, they have to pay up. And I'm a big fan of NATO. But they have to pay up. She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great. Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.  We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out. We have, during his regime, during President Obama's regime, we've doubled our national debt. We're up to $20 trillion.

>So my plan -- we're going to renegotiate trade deals. We're going to have a lot of free trade. We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now. But we have horrible deals. Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever. Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy. You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them. You go upstate New York. Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places. We're bringing our jobs back. I am going to renegotiate NAFTA. And if I can't make a great deal -- then we're going to terminate NAFTA and we're going to create new deals. We're going to have trade, but we're going -- we're going to terminate it, we're going to make a great trade deal. And if we can't, we're going to do it -- we're going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster. We are going to cut taxes massively. We're going to cut business taxes massively. They're going to start hiring people. We're going to bring the $2.5 trillion ...that's offshore back into the country. We are going to start the engine rolling again, because... right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP.

I liked it a bit though, because I thought it cut to a lot of issues that GOP/Conservative voters have with Hillary and Trump, and while it should've helped Trump by being more in his supposed 'sweet spot', it was such an incoherent, rambling mess most the time, it completely eliminated the advantage.  Conversely, it gave Clinton an opportunity to really face the 'tough' questions and hammer home solid answers (though she certainly pivoted from a few questions I think we all would've liked some more direct answers to).

In total, I think the debate was a microcosm of what (some of) Fox News and mainstream conservatives feel about Trump and the election - they don't like Clinton, but they know Trump is an asshat and a terrible choice.  I thought Wallace did a service by giving questions that allowed Clinton to really speak directly to the fears of moderate conservatives, and really make her case as being a perfectly acceptable and reasonable candidate for President - not this crazy boogie man that the alt-right and hardliners have...trumped...her up to be.

If the Republicans had actually nominated a semi-serious candidate, we would probably be having some very sharp and revealing policy discussion where Clinton and this imaginary Republican go toe to toe on where economic growth comes from, how to untangle Syria, and what can be done to improve race relations. We would here about body cameras, carbon caps, and entitlement reform like they were nothing.

Instead, we get this shit. Clinton is one of the smartest people out there and will be a much better President than she is a campaigner. If the GOP thinks they will have an easy time in 2020 they are in for a surprise.",-0.000993201686788,0.0523419850748
